<p class='line0'>Here the sinking sun hath broken through a forest close as night;</p>
<p class='line0'>Plashing all the deepened darkness with its thick and wine-like light.</p>
<p class='line0'>Shivered lies the broad, red sunbeam slant athwart the withered leaf,</p>
<p class='line0'>Laughing back the startled shadows from their high and holy grief;</p>
<p class='line0'>Down yon dusk-pool, slant, obliquely, shoots a line like sparry splinter,</p>
<p class='line0'>As the waking flush of spring-time lightens up the eyes in winter:</p>
<p class='line0'>Dimming as it straineth downward melts the red light of the sun,</p>
<p class='line0'>Darkling pool and piercing beamlet mingling whitely into one.</p>
<p class='line0'>Fallen rays, like broken crystals, spangle thick the shadowy ground,</p>
<p class='line0'>Ragged fragments, glorious gushes scattered richly, redly round.</p>
<p class='line0'>Where the lazy lilies languish, one intruding sunbeam creeps;</p>
<p class='line0'>In the arms of slumberous shadow, like a child it sinks and sleeps;</p>
<p class='line0'>And the quiet leaves around it seem to think it all their own,</p>
<p class='line0'>’Mid the grass and lightened lilies sleeping silent and alone.</p>
<p class='line0'>Here the dew-damp lingers longest ’mid the plushy fountain moss;</p>
<p class='line0'>Here the bergamot’s red blossom leans the stilly stream across;</p>
<p class='line0'>Here the shade is darkly silent; here the breeze is liquid cool,</p>
<p class='line0'>And the very air seems married to the freshness of that pool.</p>
<p class='line0'>See, where down its depths pellucid, Nature’s purest waters well,</p>
<p class='line0'>Breaking up in curving current, wimpled line and bubbly swell;</p>
<p class='line0'>While in swift and noiseless beauty, through the deep and dewy grass,</p>
<p class='line0'>O’er the rock and down the valley, see the hurrying waters pass.</p>
<p class='line0'>Oh, how dreamy grow my senses, as I couch me ’mid the flowers,</p>
<p class='line0'>Oh, how still the blue sky looketh, oh, how noteless creep the hours;</p>
<p class='line0'>Oh, how wide the silence seemeth, not a sound disturbing comes,</p>
<p class='line0'>Save a drowsy, sleepy buzzing, that around continuous hums;</p>
<p class='line0'>And I seem to float out loosely on weak slumber’s languid breast,</p>
<p class='line0'>With a kind of half reluctance that sinks gradually to rest.</p>
<p class='line0'>Distant faces group around me, kindly eyes look in my own,</p>
<p class='line0'>And I hear, though indistinctly, voices of the lost and gone:</p>
<p class='line0'>His whose bark went down in tempest; his whose life and death were gloom;</p>
<p class='line0'>His whose hopes and young ambitions fell and faded on the tomb;</p>
<p class='line0'>Oh, again his earnest language breaks upon my dreaming ear,</p>
<p class='line0'>And I catch the tones that waking I shall never, never hear.</p>

<p class='line0'>Oh, with more than the pilgrim of Mecca’s devotion,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;When he looks on the shrine which his worship endears,</p>
<p class='line0'>Is the glance which we cast at the young heart’s devotion,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Its first rose of summer—the last which it bears;</p>
<p class='line0'>Bright as a halo of sunshine reposing</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;At break of the morn on a billowless stream,</p>

<p class='line0'>Thus, thus must thou dwell on each glance of affection,</p>

<p class='line0'>When thy bosom first heaved at the fear of detection,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;And its secret alone was imparted to mine;</p>
<p class='line0'>It is linked with each thought that is born in thy waking,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;It embosoms each fancy that softens thy sleep,</p>
<p class='line0'>And, if e’er it be wild as the waves in their breaking,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;’Tis the image of Heaven that breaks on the deep!</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>For vainly the bosom whose pulses have throbbed</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;To the beat of a heart it had warmed with its fire,</p>
<p class='line0'>Seeks to freeze the remembrance of tears it has sobbed,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;And to smother the anguish of pining desire;</p>
<p class='line0'>The remembrance will live, the remembrance will cling.</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;As the ever-green ivy encircles the oak,</p>
<p class='line0'>And the tempest may strike with its withering wing,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;But together they bend and together are broke!</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>Bright star of my soul! thus united we stand,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Intermingled in being and blended in breath,</p>
<p class='line0'>Come fate with her darkest, her gloomiest band,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;We will bend, we will break undivided in death;</p>
<p class='line0'>’Twas Heaven decreed it, ’twas Heaven that wove</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;The tie which has bound us in home and in heart,</p>
<p class='line0'>And this only we know, we live on but to love,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;And thus loving we never, oh, never can part!</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is convenient to place an indefinite title at the
head of this article, in order to notice various classes
of independent phenomena which immediately address
themselves to the eye; and which are either
plain developments of electrical action, or simply
atmospheric meteors, or appearances resulting from
its reflecting and refractive properties, or of obscure
origin, but manifested in the atmosphere. To the
former class the lightning belongs, beautifully playing
among the distant clouds, or flashing with blinding
glare and tremendous effect near the surface of
the earth, warning man and beast of the presence of
an agency able to extinguish animal and vegetable
life in a moment, and utterly inappreciable in its
swiftness, subtility and power. At the close of a
hot, sultry day, over a level country, the igneous
meteor often exhibits itself, in rapidly succeeding,
broad, noiseless, and imposing sheets of flame, lighting
up the whole range of the horizon, revealing for
the moment the contour of the distant landscape upon
which the shadows of the night have gathered, and
discovering the outline of the clouds in the dusky
sky. These displays, however startling to “the
poor Indian, whose untutored mind” is alarmed at
the slightest deviation from the ordinary aspect of
things, are always harmless, and invite by their innocuousness
and fascination the cultivated races to
watch the bounding coruscations of the elastic element,
besides contributing to render the fields of corn
ripe unto the harvest. But it is otherwise when
heat has overcharged the atmosphere with vapors,
becoming piled into clouds of gigantic dimensions
and massive architecture, which are often propelled
by antagonist currents, and in different electrical conditions.
After an unusual calm of nature, oppressive
to the animal system, during which not a movement
of the air is perceptible, and the leaves hang motionless
upon the trees, while the brute creation indicate
some intelligence of an impending change by their
restlessness, an explosion commences. The flash is
seen, the thunder heard, and the clouds open their
watery store-house, a few distant and heavy drops
increasing into a cataract of rain. Flash rapidly follows
flash, and the interval between each appearance
and the accompanying thunder peal becomes
less. The pale hue of the lightning is exchanged
for a vivid glare, in which a deep yellow, red, or
blue is the predominant color, a variety of aberrations
marking its course, the zigzag form showing
that the fearful agent is near terrestrial objects. In
this manner, “the detraction that wasteth at noonday”
is frequently exhibited, now striking man and
beast to the earth, or rending asunder the mighty
oak of the forest, or firing the vessel of the hapless
seaman, or shivering “the cloud-capt towers and
gorgeous palaces,” the fanes of religion and the fortresses
of war. Man has then a solemn sense of his
helplessness and danger; and almost every creature
sympathizes with him. The eel is restless in his
muddy bed—the horse trembles beneath his rider—the
cattle gather lowing to a covert—the eagle nestles
in the cleft of the rock with folded wings—the hart
looks wild and anxious: only the poor seal seems to
experience agreeable sensations, for he will come
out of his hiding-place in the deep, at the call of the
thunder, and repose upon some overhanging ledge,
as if calmly enjoying the convulsion of the elements.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Since the month of June 1752, when Franklin
performed the celebrated kite experiment, by which
he became the modern Prometheus, bringing down
the celestial fire to the earth, the identity of lightning
and electricity has been universally known.
The theory of the electric fluid, as it is called, is to
be sought for in philosophical treatises, our province
being to notice its distribution, phenomena, and effects.
That subtle principle which the Greeks denominated
electricity, from <span class='it'>elektron</span>, amber, because
the property was first noticed in that substance, appears
to be a universally diffused agent, its presence
having been detected in connection with the clouds,
with hail, rain and snow, with vegetation, animals,
and the interior strata of the earth. But undue accumulation
transpires—the electrical equilibrium is
disturbed; and the resulting phenomena of equalization
are lightning and thunder. Thus two clouds,
or a cloud and the earth, unequally electrified, tend
to return to a condition of equality through a conducting
medium, a metallic or moist body having
the preference as a conductor, the discharge of electricity
appearing in the form of a spark or flash, accompanied
by a loud detonation according to its
violence, the peal rebounding in echoes from cloud
to cloud, and from hill to hill. Some regions of the
globe are peculiarly subject to accumulations of electricity.
Mr. Hamilton, in his work on Asia Minor,
observes—“One of the most remarkable phenomena
which I observed in Angora, was the great degree
of electricity which seemed to pervade every thing.
I observed it particularly in silk handkerchiefs, linen
and woollen stuffs. At times, when I went to bed
in the dark, the sparks which were emitted from
the blanket gave it the appearance of a sheet of fire;
when I took up a silk handkerchief, the crackling
noise would resemble that of breaking a handful of
dried leaves or grass; and on one or two occasions
I clearly felt my hands and fingers tingle from the
electric fluid. I could only attribute it to the extreme
dryness of the atmosphere, and momentary
friction. I did not observe that it was at all influenced
by wind; the phenomena were the same,
whether by night or by day, in wind or calm. Not
a cloud was visible during the whole of my stay.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Similar striking indications of the prevalence of
electric action have frequently been observed by travelers
when near the summits of high mountains, as
by Sir W. J. Hooker on Ben Nevis, Saussure on
Mont Blanc, and Tupper on Mount Etna. The latter,
descending a field of snow, a good conductor,
felt a slight shock upon entering a cloud which
seemed electric, with a sensation of pain in the back.
The hair of his head stood erect, and upon moving
the hand near the head, a humming sound proceeded
from it, which arose from a succession of sparks.
Though a situation of great danger, yet we have
several instances of such clouds having been traversed
with impunity, when in the act of electrical
explosion. The Abbé Richard, in August 1778,
passed through a thunder-cloud on the small mountain
called Boyer, between Chalons and Tournus.
Before he entered the cloud, the thunder sounded, as
it is wont to do, with a prolonged reverberation; but
when enveloped in it, only single peals were heard,
with intervals of silence, without any roll; and after
he had passed above the cloud, it reverberated as before,
and the lightning flashed. The sister of M.
Arago was a party to a similar occurrence between
Estagel and Limoux, and some officers of engineers
likewise, during a trigonometrical survey on the
Pyrenees.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The energy of atmospheric electricity appears to
decrease as we recede from the equator to the poles,
thus sympathizing with light and heat; for it is in
tropical countries that the most terrific flashes of
lightning and the loudest bursts of heaven’s artillery
occur. Awful as these manifestations are occasionally
in our temperate climate, they are but as a skirmishing
of outposts to the general engagement of
armies, when compared with inter-tropical displays.
In Hindustan, in the Indian Ocean, along the African
coast off Cape St. Verde, and in Central America,
there is often a scene exhibited, which seems a rehearsal
of the day “when the heavens being on fire
shall pass away with a great noise.” Humboldt,
during his residence at Cumana, witnessed a coincident
development of electrical action, peculiar
atmospheric phenomena, and terrestrial disturbance,
during what is called the winter of that region.
From the 10th of October to the 3d of November, a
reddish vapor rose in the evening, and in a few
minutes covered the sky. The hygrometer gave no
indication of humidity; the diurnal heat was from
82·4° to 89·6°. The vapor disappeared occasionally
in the middle of the night, when brilliantly white
clouds formed in the zenith, extending toward the
horizon. They were sometimes so transparent that
they did not conceal stars even of the fourth magnitude,
and the lunar spots were clearly distinguishable
through the veil. The clouds were arranged in
masses at equal distances, and seemed to be at a prodigious
elevation. From the 28th of October to the
3d of November, the fog was thicker than it had been
before; and the heat at night was stifling, though the
thermometer indicated only 78·8°. There was no
evening breeze. The sky appeared as if on fire, and
the ground was every where cracked and dusty.
About two o’clock in the afternoon of November
4th, large clouds of extraordinary blackness enveloped
the mountains of the Brigantine and Tataraqual,
extending gradually to the zenith. About four,
thunder was heard overhead, but at an immense
height, and with a dull and often interrupted sound.
At the moment of the strongest electric explosion,
two shocks of an earthquake, separated by an interval
of fifteen seconds, were felt. The people in the
streets filled the air with their cries. Boupland, who
was examining plants, was nearly thrown upon the
floor, and Humboldt, who was lying in his hammock,
felt the concussion strongly. A few minutes before
the first, there was a violent gust of wind followed
by large drops of rain. The sky remained cloudy,
and the blast was succeeded by a dead calm, which
continued all night. The sunset was a scene of great
magnificence. The dark atmospheric shroud was
rent asunder close to the horizon, and the sun appeared
at 12° of altitude on an indigo ground, his disc
enormously enlarged and distorted. The clouds were
gilded on the edges, and bundles of rays reflecting
the most brilliant prismatic colors extended over the
heavens. About nine in the evening there was a
third shock, which, though much slighter, was evidently
attended with a subterranean noise. In the
night between the 3d and 4th of November, the red
vapor before mentioned had been so thick, that the
place of the moon could only be distinguished by a
beautiful halo 20° in diameter. The vapor ceased
to appear on the 7th; the atmosphere then assumed
its former purity; and the night of the 11th was cool
and extremely lovely. This account, with similar
details from other observers, seems to indicate a
more intimate relation than is generally admitted between
the interior of the earth and its external atmosphere.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Among the regions peculiarly subject to electric
phenomena is the country around the estuary of the
Rio Plata. In the year 1793, one of the most destructive
thunder-storms perhaps on record, happened
at Buenos Ayres, when thirty-seven places in the
city were struck by the lightning, and nineteen of
the inhabitants killed. It is an observation of Mr.
Darwin, founded on statements in books of travels,
that thunder-storms are very common near the
mouths of great rivers; and he conjectures that this
may arise from the mixture of large bodies of fresh
and salt water disturbing the electrical equilibrium.
“Even,” he remarks, “during our occasional visit
to this part of South America, we heard of a ship,
two churches and a house, having been struck.
Both the church and the house I saw shortly afterward.
Some of the effects were curious: the paper,
for nearly a foot on each side of the line where the
bell-wires had run, was blackened. The metal had
been fused, and although the room was about fifteen
feet high, the globules, dropping on the chairs and
furniture, had drilled in them a chain of minute
holes. A part of the wall was shattered as if by
gunpowder, and the fragments had been blown off
with force sufficient to indent the wall on the opposite
side of the room. The frame of a looking-glass
was blackened; the gilding must have been volatilized,
for a smelling-bottle, which stood on the
chimney-piece, was coated with bright metallic
particles, which adhered as firmly as if they had
been enameled.” Near the shores of the Rio Plata,
in a broad band of sand hillocks, he found those singular
specimens of electric architecture, a group of
vitrified siliceous tubes, formed by the lightning
striking into loose sand. These tubes had a glossy
surface, and were about two inches in circumference,
the thickness of the wall of each tube varying
from the twentieth to the thirtieth part of an inch.
Four sets were noticed, probably not produced by
successive distinct charges, but by the lightning dividing
itself into separate branches before entering
the ground. Similar cylindrical formations have
been noticed in other places. Dr. Priestley has described,
in the Philosophical Transactions, some
siliceous tubes, which were found in digging into
the ground, under a tree, where a man had been
killed by lightning; and at Drigg, in Cumberland,
three were observed within an area of fifteen yards,
one of which was traced to a depth of not less than
thirty feet. In the temperate climates electrical
phenomena are most common, and usually most energetic
in the summer season, and the displays are
grander and more formidable in mountainous than in
level countries. As we approach the poles, they
become less striking; thunder is rarely heard in high
northern latitudes, and only as a feeble detonation;
and though lightning is more common, it is seldom
destructive. In Iceland, in the winter, it often plays
in the impressive but harmless manner which the
natives call laptelltur. This is a fluctuating appearance
of the whole sky, as if on fire, accompanied by
a strong wind and drifting snow, but inflicting no
further damage than that arising from the terrified
cattle falling over the rocks in their efforts to escape
from the phenomenon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The rapidity of lightning, as measured by means
of the camera lucida, M. Halvig estimates at probably
eight or ten miles in a second, or about forty
times greater velocity than that of sound; and according
to M. Gay-Lussac, a flash sometimes darts more
than three miles at once in a straight direction. M.
Arago distinguishes three classes of lightning: First,
luminous discharges characterized by a long streak
of light, very thin, and well defined at the edges, of
a white, violet, or purple hue, moving in a straight
line, or deviating into a zigzag track, frequently dividing
into two or more streams in striking terrestrial
objects, but invariably proceeding from a single
point. Secondly, he notices expanded flashes spreading
over a vast surface without having any apparent
depth, of a red, blue, or violet color, not so active as
the former class, and generally confined to the edges
of the clouds from which they appear to proceed.
Thirdly, he mentions concentrated masses of light,
which he terms globular lightning, which seem to
occupy time, to endure for several seconds, and to
have a progressive motion. Mr. Hearder of Plymouth
describes a discharge of lightning of this kind
on the Dartmouth hills, very near to him. Several
vivid flashes had occurred before the mass of clouds
approached the hill on which he was standing; and
before he had time to retreat from his dangerous
position, a tremendous crash and explosion burst close
to him. The spark had the appearance of a nucleus
of intensely ignited matter, followed by a flood of
light. It struck the path near him, and dashed with
fearful brilliancy down its whole length to a rivulet
at the foot of the hill, where it terminated. Analogous
to the discharges described as globular lightning
are the fire-balls so often noticed, about which
there has been no little scepticism; but the evidence
cannot reasonably be doubted, that displays of electrical
light have repeatedly occurred, conveying the
impression of balls of fire to the observer. An instance
is given by Mr. Chalmers while on board the
Montague, of seventy-four guns, bearing the flag of
Admiral Chambers. In the account read to the
Royal Society, he states, that “on November 4th,
1749, while taking an observation on the quarter-deck,
one of the quarter-masters requested him to
look to windward, upon which he observed a large
ball of blue fire rolling along on the surface of the
water, as large as a mill-stone, at about three miles
distance. Before they could raise the main-tack, the
ball had reached within forty yards of the main-chains,
when it rose perpendicularly with a fearful
explosion, and shattered the main-topmast to pieces.”
In an account of the fatal effects of lightning in June
1826, on the Malvern Hills, when two ladies were
struck dead, it is stated, that the electric discharge appeared
as a mass of fire rolling along the hill toward
the building in which the party had taken shelter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Snow Harris remarks upon the difficulty of
explaining these appearances on the principles applicable
to the ordinary electric spark. The amazing
rapidity of the latter, and the momentary duration of
the light, render it impossible that they should be
identical with it; but he conjectures that there may
be a “glow discharge” preceding the main shock,
some of the atmospheric particles yielding up their
electricity by a gradual process before a discharge of
the whole system takes place. In this view, the distinct
balls of fire of sensible duration which have been
perceived, are produced in a given point or points of
a charged system previously to the more general and
rapid union of the electrical forces—a supposition
which will apply as well to the Mariner’s Lights, or
St. Elmo’s Fire, observed during storms of thunder
and lightning at sea. Pliny mentions lights noticed
by the Roman mariners during tempests, flickering
about their vessels, to which Seneca likewise makes
allusion. By the superstitions of modern times they
have been converted into indications of the guardian
presence of St. Elmo, the patron saint of the sailor,
hence called <span class='it'>cuerpo sante</span> by the Spanish mariners.
During the second voyage of Columbus among the
West India islands, a sudden gust of heavy wind
came on in the night, and his crew considered themselves
in great peril, until they beheld several of these
lambent flames playing about the tops of the masts,
and gliding along the rigging, which they hailed as
an assurance of their supernatural protector being
near. Fernando Columbus records the circumstance
in a manner strongly characteristic of the age in
which he lived. “On the same Saturday, in the
night, was seen St. Elmo, with seven lighted tapers,
at the topmast. There was much rain and great
thunder. I mean to say that those lights were seen
which mariners affirm to be the body of St. Elmo,
on beholding which they chanted many litanies and
orisons, holding it for certain, that in the tempest in
which he appears, no one is in danger.” A similar
mention is made of this nautical superstition in the
voyage of Magellan. During several great storms
the presence of the saint was welcomed, appearing
at the topmast with a lighted candle, and sometimes
with two, upon which the people shed tears of joy,
received great consolation, and saluted him according
to the custom of the Catholic seamen; but he ungraciously
vanished, disappearing with a great flash
of lightning which nearly blinded the crew.</p>

<p class='caption'><span class='bold'>Tower of St. Mark’s, Venice.</span></p>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>It is a striking instance of the triumph of mind,
that by the introduction of lightning conductors into
different civilized states, the power of this most
energetic agent of nature is controled, and comparative
security provided for life and property, otherwise
in imminent jeopardy, when a severe
thunder-storm occurs. Experience has taught
the prime importance of furnishing exposed or
elevated structures with a conducting apparatus,
and has sufficiently shown that the immunity from
danger enjoyed by many an unprotected building
has been merely accidental; for when the
teeming thunder-cloud has been wafted within
reach of the edifice hitherto unscathed, the
delusion has vanished that man may carelessly
and with impunity thrust up his handiwork
into the region of storms, as if daring the fury
of the tempest, and inviting down its vengeance.
The fine tower of St. Mark’s, at Venice, rising
to the height of 360 feet, terminates in a pyramid
which was severely injured in 1388. In
1417 the pyramid was again struck, and set on
fire, having been constructed of wood. The
same event happened in 1489, when it was entirely
consumed. After being rebuilt of stone,
the fell lightning renewed its destructive stroke
in 1548, 1565, 1653 and 1745; and on the last
occasion the whole tower was rent in thirty-seven
places, and almost destroyed. It was
again ravaged in 1761 and 1762, but in 1766 a
lightning rod was put up, which has since protected
it from damage. At Glogau, in Silesia,
an interesting example of the value of conductors
occurred in the year 1782. On the 8th of
May, about eight o’clock in the evening, a
thunder-storm from the west approached the
powder magazine established in the Galgnuburg.
An intensely vivid flash of lightning took
place, accompanied instantly with such a tremendous
peal of thunder, that the sentinel on duty was
stupefied, and remained for awhile senseless, but no
disaster occurred. Some laborers at a short distance
from the magazine saw the lightning issue from the
cloud and strike the point of the conductor, which
conveyed it in safety by the combustible material.
A different result took place with reference to a
large quantity of unprotected ammunition, belonging
to the republic of Venice, deposited in the vaults of
the church of St. Nazaire, at Brescia. The church
was struck with lightning in the month of August,
1767, and the electric fluid, descending to the vaults,
exploded upward of 207,600 lbs. of powder, reducing
nearly one-sixth of the fine city to ruins, and destroying
about 3000 of the inhabitants. The Indians, whenever
the sky wears a lowering aspect, so as to threaten
a severe thunder-storm, are said to leave their pursuits
and take refuge under the nearest beech-tree, considering
it a complete protection, as it is affirmed
that no instance has occurred of the beech having
been struck by atmospheric electricity, when other
trees of the American forests have been shivered
into splinters in its neighborhood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For ages the inhabitants of the globe have seen
the lightning flash and heard the thunder rattle; and
some writers upon the occult sciences of the ancients,
as Salverte, have supposed that, tutored by
experience, without any understanding of the theory
of the subject, they possessed the secret of warding
off from their buildings the thunderbolt by a conducting
apparatus. It is certain that extraordinary intimations
to this effect may be culled from their
writings. Pliny states that Tullus Hostilius, practicing
Numa’s art of bringing down fire from heaven,
and performing it incorrectly, was struck with lightning—a
fate which Professor Richman of St. Petersburg
experienced, while performing incautiously
the sublime experiment of Franklin, measuring the
strength of the electricity brought down by a metallic
rod in a thunder-storm, being instantly killed.
Pliny likewise mentions the laurel as the only
earthly production which lightning does not strike;
hence, as a protection, these trees were planted
around the temple of Apollo. Columella, however,
mentions white vines surrounding the house of Tarchon,
the Etruscan, for the same purpose. These
expedients may provoke a smile without deserving
one; for there can be no doubt that trees sufficiently
high around a temple, or succulent plants covering a
dwelling, will exercise to some extent a protective
power, and act as a regular system of conductors.
Salverte mentions several medals which appear to
have reference to this subject, particularly one
which represents the temple of Juno, the goddess of
the air, the roof of which is armed with pointed
rods. He quotes also Michaelis, upon the temple of
Jerusalem, to show that the Jews were not unacquainted
with the art of protecting their public buildings—a
position grounded upon the following facts:
“1. That there is nothing to indicate that the lightning
ever struck the temple of Jerusalem during the
lapse of a thousand years.” This, of course, does
not make the fact certain; but when, as M. Arago
justly remarks, we consider how carefully the ancient
authors recorded the cases in which their
public buildings were injured by lightning, we may
accept the silence observed respecting the temple of
Jerusalem, as proof that it was never struck. For
three centuries the cathedral of Geneva, the most
elevated in the city, has enjoyed a similar immunity,
although inferior buildings have been repeatedly
damaged. Saussure discovered the reason of this, in
the tower being entirely covered with tinned iron
plates, connected with different masses of metal on
the roof, and again communicating with the ground
by means of metallic pipes. “2. That according to
the account of Josephus, a forest of spikes with
golden or gilt points, and very sharp, covered the
roof of this temple; a remarkable feature of resemblance
with the temple of Juno represented on the
Roman medals. 3. That this roof communicated
with the caverns in the hill of the temple, by means
of metallic tubes, placed in connection with the thick
gilding that covered the whole exterior of the building;
the points of the spikes there necessarily producing
the effect of lightning-rods. How are we to
suppose that it was only by chance they discharged
so important a function; that the advantage received
from it had not been calculated; that the spikes
were erected in such great numbers only to prevent
the birds from lodging upon and defiling the roof of
the temple? Yet this is the sole utility which the
historian Josephus attributes to them.” Upon a
sober review of these facts, it is difficult to resist the
conclusion that the ancient world had some proficiency
in the art of guiding the electric fluid from
the bosom of the clouds, conducting it in a prescribed
course, and thus disarming it of its terrors.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The subject of electrical agency is intimately connected
with that of magnetism, to which this is the
fittest place to glance—one of the most recondite
points of physical science. The relation between
the two is evident, from the notorious fact that lightning
often renders steel magnetic, and disturbs the
magnetism of the magnetised needle, so that in
thunder-storms the compass needles of a ship have
frequently been seriously injured. The magnetic
agency, like electricity, has a general distribution
over the earth, but the phenomena differ in different
parts of the world, and are subject to periodical differences
in the same place, the cause of which is
very little understood. Every one is acquainted
with the polarity of a freely suspended magnetic
needle, or its tendency to lie parallel with the earth’s
axis, pointing nearly north and south in every region
of the globe. What is called the <span class='it'>dip</span> or <span class='it'>inclination</span>
of the needle is its divergence from a perfectly horizontal
position. Thus the north pole of the needle
inclines downward in the latitude of London at an
angle of 70°, but conveyed toward the equator, the
dip diminishes, till no inclination at all appears.
Transported farther toward the south, the dip again
discovers itself, but in an opposite direction, the
south pole of the needle inclining downward. “To
understand the reason of this dip of the magnetic
needle, and of its general direction, we have only to
consider that the earth itself operates as a great
magnet, the poles of which are situated beneath its
surface. The directive property of the needle is owing
to these poles; and when the needle is on the
north side of the equator, the north pole of the earth
having the greatest effect, the needle is attracted
downward toward the north pole; hence exactly
over the magnetic pole the needle would be vertical.
Similar phenomena occur in the southern hemisphere;
but here the south pole predominates, and of
course depresses the corresponding pole of the
needle; while at the magnetic equator, from the
equal action of both poles, the needle will assume an
exactly horizontal position.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But neither the magnetic equator nor the magnetic
poles coincide precisely with the geographical equator
and poles, and this difference constitutes what is
termed the <span class='it'>variation</span> of the needle. From calculation,
the north magnetic pole had been fixed in latitude
70°, and longitude 98° 30′ west, a spot which
Commander Ross approached within the distance of
ten miles, in the year 1830, but was unable to verify
the site, for want of the requisite instruments. Upon
going through a long series of calculations afterward
himself, he concluded the above position to have
been erroneously assigned, and that the real point
lay in latitude 70° 5′ 17″ north, and longitude 96° 46′
45″ west, a spot on the western coast of Boothia,
which he prepared to reach. On the first of June,
1831, at eight o’clock in the morning, he arrived at
the site to which his calculations pointed, and found
the same day the amount of the dip to be 89° 59′,
only one minute less than 90°, the vertical position,
which would have precisely indicated the polar station;
and the horizontal needles, suspended in the
most delicate manner possible, did not betray the
slightest movement. The spot was an unattractive
level site along the coast, rising into ridges from fifty
to sixty feet high, about a mile inland. The wish
expressed by the discoverer was natural, that a
place so important had possessed more of mark or
note, but Nature had erected no monument to denote
the spot which she had chosen as the centre of one
of her “great and dark powers.” A cairn of some
magnitude was constructed by the adventurers, upon
which the British flag was planted, and underneath,
a canister was buried, containing a record of the interesting
enterprise.</p>

<p class='caption'><span class='bold'>Aurora Borealis—Loch Leven.</span></p>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>The magnetic needle has frequently exhibited
violent disturbance when the Aurora Borealis has
appeared. This has led to the surmise that these
brilliant lights are connected with the electric and
magnetic properties of the earth, though in a manner
which we cannot explain. It has been remarked
that during the appearance of the aurora the electric
fluid may often be readily collected from the air. If
a current of electricity also be passed through an exhausted
receiver, a very correct imitation of the
auroral light will be produced, displaying the same
variety of color and intensity, and the same undulating
motions. It is highly probable, therefore, that
the beautiful and fantastic meteoric display is connected
with electricity; but great obscurity rests
upon this department of meteorology.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of all optical phenomena, the Aurora Borealis, or
the northern day-break, is one of the most striking,
especially in the regions where its full glory is revealed.
The site of the appearance, in the north
part of the heavens, and its close resemblance to the
aspect of the sky before sunrise, have originated the
name. The “Derwentwater Lights” was long the
appellation common in the north of England, owing
to their display on the night after the execution of
the unfortunate earl of that name. The scene in
the illustration is a picture of the auroral light, as
observed from the neighborhood of Loch Leven—a
scene in itself admirably calculated to exhibit the
phenomenon; and to convey any adequate idea of
its magical aspect, as seen in high latitudes, the
painter’s hand and the poet’s art are needed. A native
Russian, Lomonosov, thus refers to the spectacle:—</p>

<p class='pindent'>The appearances exhibited by the aurora are so
various as to render it impossible to comprehend
every particular in a description that must be necessarily
brief and general. A cloud, or haze, is commonly
seen in the northern region of the heavens,
but often bearing toward the east or west, assuming
the form of an arc, seldom attaining a greater altitude
than 40°, but varying in extent from 5° to 100°.
The upper edge of the cloud is luminous, sometimes
brilliant and irregular. The lower part is frequently
dark and thick, with the clear sky appearing between
it and the horizon. Streams of light shoot up in columnar
forms from the upper part of the cloud, now
extending but a few degrees, then as far as the zenith,
and even beyond it. Instances occur in which the
whole hemisphere is covered with these coruscations;
but the brilliancy is the greatest, and the light
the strongest, in the north, near the main body of
the meteor. The streamers have in general a tremulous
motion, and when close together present the
appearance of waves, or sheets of light, following
each other in rapid succession. But no rule obtains
with reference to these streaks, which have acquired
the name of “the merry dancers,” from their volatility,
becoming more quick in their motions in stormy
weather, as if sympathizing with the wildness of
the blast. Such is the extraordinary aspect they
present, that it is not surprising the rude Indians
should gaze upon them as the spirits of their fathers
roaming through the land of souls. They are
variously white, pale red, or of a deep blood-color,
and sometimes the appearance of the whole rainbow
as to hue is presented. When several streamers
emerging from different points unite at the zenith, a
small and dense meteor is formed, which seems to
burn with greater violence than the separate parts,
and glows with a green, blue, or purple light. The
display is over sometimes in a few minutes, or continues
for hours, or through the whole night, and appears
for several nights in succession. Captain
Beechey remarked a sudden illumination to occur at
one extremity of the auroral arch, the light passing
along the belt with a tremulous hesitating movement
toward the opposite end, exhibiting the colors of the
rainbow; and as an illustration of this appearance, he
refers to that presented by the rays of some molluscous
animals in motion. Captain Parry notices the
same effect as a common one with the aurora, and
compares it, as far as its motion is concerned, to a
person holding a long ribbon by one end, and giving
it an undulatory movement through its whole length,
though its general position remains the same. Captain
Sabine likewise speaks of the arch being bent
into convolutions, resembling those of a snake in motion.
Both Parry, Franklin, and Beechey agree in
the observation that no streamers were ever noticed
shooting downward from the arch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The preceding statement refers to aurora in high
northern latitudes, where the full magnificence of
the phenomenon is displayed. It forms a fine compensation
for the long and dreary night to which
these regions are subject, the gay and varying aspect
of the heavens contrasting refreshingly with the repelling
and monotonous appearance of the earth. We
have already stated that the direction in which the
aurora generally makes its first appearance, or the
quarter in which the arch formed by this meteor is
usually seen, is to the northward. But this does not
hold good of very high latitudes, for by the expeditions
which have wintered in the ice, it was almost
always seen to the southward; while by Captain
Beechey, in the Blossom, in Kotzerne Sound, 250
miles to the southward of the ice, it was always observed
in a northern direction. It would appear,
therefore, from this fact, that the margin of the region
of packed ice is most favorable to the production of
the meteor. The reports of the Greenland ships confirm
this idea; for, according to their concurrent testimony,
the meteoric display has a more brilliant
aspect to vessels passing near the situation of the
compact ice, than to others entered far within it.
Instances, however, are not wanting, of the aurora
appearing to the south of the zenith in comparatively
low latitudes. Lieutenant Chappell, in his voyage
to Hudson’s Bay, speaks of its forming in the zenith,
in a shape resembling that of an umbrella, pouring
down streams of light from all parts of its periphery,
which fell vertically over the hemisphere in every
direction. As we retire from the Pole, the phenomenon
becomes a rarer occurrence, and is less perfectly
and distinctly developed. In September, 1828,
it was observed in England as a vast arch of silvery
light, extending over nearly the whole of the heavens,
transient gleams of light separating from the main
body of the luminosity; but in September, 1827, its
hues were red and brilliant. Dr. Dalton has furnished
the following account of an aurora, as observed by
him on the 15th of October, 1792:—“Attention,” he
remarks, “was first excited by a remarkably red appearance
of the clouds to the south, which afforded
sufficient light to read by at 8 o’clock in the evening,
though there was no moon nor light in the north.
From half-past nine to ten there was a large, luminous,
horizontal arch to the southward, and several
faint concentric arches northward. It was particularly
noticed that all the arches seemed exactly bisected
by the plain of the magnetic meridian. At
half-past ten o’clock streamers appeared, very low
in the south-east, running to and fro from west to
east. They increased in number, and began to approach
the zenith apparently with an accelerated
velocity, when all on a sudden the whole hemisphere
was covered with them, and exhibited such an appearance
as surpasses all description. The intensity
of the light, the prodigious number and volatility of
the beams, the grand intermixture of all the prismatic
colors in their utmost splendor, variegating the
glowing canopy with the most luxuriant and enchanting
scenery, afforded an awful, but at the same
time the most pleasing and sublime spectacle in nature.
Every one gazed with astonishment, but the
uncommon grandeur of the scene only lasted one minute.
The variety of colors disappeared, and the
beams lost their lateral motion, and were converted
into the flashing radiations. The aurora continued
for several hours.” A copious deposition of dew—hard
gales in the English channel—and a sudden
thaw after great cold in northern regions, are circumstances
which have been frequently noticed in connection
with auroral displays.</p>

<p class='caption'><span class='bold'>Aurora Borealis.</span></p>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>The sky of the southern hemisphere occasionally
exhibits this strange and mysterious light, contrary
to an old opinion upon the subject; and here it must
be called Aurora Australis, the southern day-break.
Its appearance, however, is far from being so common
as in the northern zone, and is much less imposing.
Don Antonio Ulloa, off Cape Horn, in the year
1745, witnessed the first appearance of the kind upon
record in this region. Upon the clearing off of a thick
mist, a light was observed in the southern horizon,
extending to an elevation of about thirty degrees,
sometimes of a reddish color, and sometimes like the
light which precedes the rise of the moon, but occasionally
more brilliant. Captain Cook, in the same
latitudes, had more distinct views of the luminous
streamers adorning the night-sky of the south. In
the course of his second voyage he remarks, that on
February the 17th, 1773, “a beautiful phenomenon
was observed in the heavens. It consisted of long
colors of a clear, white light, shooting up from the
horizon, to the eastward, almost to the zenith, and
spreading gradually over the whole southern part of
the sky. These columns sometimes bent sideways
at their upper extremity; and though in most respects
similar to the northern lights, yet differed
from them in being always of a whitish color,
whereas ours assume various tints, especially those
of a purple and fiery hue. The stars were sometimes
hid by, and sometimes faintly to be seen
through, the substance of these southern lights, <span class='it'>Aurora
Australis</span>. The sky was generally clear when
they appeared, and the air sharp and cold, the thermometer
standing at the freezing point, the ship being
in latitude 58° south.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The history of auroral phenomena goes back to
the time of Aristotle, who undoubtedly refers to the
exhibition in his work on meteors, describing it as
occurring on calm nights, having a resemblance to
flame mingled with smoke, or to a distant view of
burning stubble, purple, bright red, and blood-color,
being the predominant hues. Notices of it are likewise
found in many of the classical writers; and the
accounts which occur in the chronicles of the middle
ages, of surprising lights in the air, converted by the
imagination of the vulgar into swords gleaming and
armies fighting, are allusions to the play of the
northern lights. There is strong reason to believe,
though the fact is perfectly inscrutable, that the
aurora has been much more common in the European
region of the northern zone, during the last century
and a half, than in former periods. A very brilliant
appearance took place on the 6th of March, 1716,
which forms the subject of a paper by Halley, who
remarks, that nothing of the kind had occurred in
England for more than eighty years, nor of the same
magnitude since 1574, or about 140 years previous,
in the reign of Queen Elizabeth, when Cambden and
Stow were eye-witnesses of it. The latter states in
his Annals, that on November 14th, “were seen in
the air strange impressions of fire and smoke to proceed
forth from a black cloud in the north toward
the south—that the next night the heavens from all
parts did seem to burn marvelous ragingly, and over
our heads the flames from the horizon round about
rising did meet, and there double and roll one in another,
as if it had been in a clear furnace.” The
year following, 1575, it was twice repeated in Holland,
but not observed in England; and as a specimen
of the tone of thought respecting the aurora, the
description of Cornelius Gemma, a professor in the
university of Louvain, may be given. Referring to
the second instance of the year, and speaking in the
language of the times, he remarks: “The form of
the Chasma of the 28th of September following, immediately
after sunset, was indeed less dreadful, but
still more confused and various; for in it were seen
a great many bright arches, out of which gradually
issued spears, cities with towers and men in battle
array; after that, there were excursions of rays
every way, waves of clouds and battles mutually
pursued and fled, and wheeling round in a surprising
manner.” This phenomenon was repeatedly observed
in the last century in Sweden, as at present;
but prior to the year 1716, the inhabitants of Upsal
considered it as a great rarity. Nothing is more
common now in Iceland than the northern lights,
exhibited during the winter with imposing grandeur
and brilliance; but Torfæus, the historian of Denmark,
an Icelander, who wrote in 1706, records his
remembrance of the time when the meteor was an
object of terror in his native island. It deserves remark,
that its more frequent occurrence in the Atlantic
regions has been accompanied by its diminution
in the eastern parts of Asia, as Baron Von
Wrangel was assured by the natives there, who
added, that formerly it was brighter than at present,
and frequently presented the vivid coloring of the
rainbow.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/i030.jpg' alt='' id='iid-0007' style='width:90%;height:auto;'/>
<p class='caption'><span class='bold'>Halos.</span></p>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>The simplest form of the halo is that of a white
concentric ring surrounding the sun or moon, a very
common appearance in our climate in relation to the
moon, occasioned by very thin vapor, or minute particles
of ice and snow, diffused through the atmosphere
deflecting the rays of light. Double rings
are occasionally seen, displaying the brightest hues
of the rainbow. The colored ring is produced by
globules of visible vapor, the resulting halo exhibiting
a character of density, and appearing contiguous
to the luminous body, according as the atmosphere
is surcharged with humidity. Hence a dense halo
close to the moon is universally and justly regarded
as an indication of coming rain. It has been stated
as an approximation, that the globules which occasion
the appearance of colored circles, vary from the
5000th to the 50,000th part of an inch in diameter.
Though seldom apparent around the sun in our climate,
yet it is only necessary to remove that glare
of light which makes delicate colors appear white,
to perceive segments of beautifully tinted halos on
most days when light fleecy clouds are present.
The illustration shows a nearly complete and slightly
eliptical ring around the sun, the lower portion hidden
by the horizon, which was distinctly observed
during the past summer in the neighborhood of Ipswich,
of an extremely pale pink and blue tint.
When Humboldt was at Cumana, a large double
halo around the moon fixed the attention of the inhabitants,
who considered it as the presage of a violent
earthquake. The hygrometer denoted great
humidity, yet the vapors appeared so perfectly in
solution, or rather so elastic and uniformly disseminated,
that they did not alter the transparency of
the atmosphere. The moon arose after a storm of
rain behind the Castle of St. Antonio. As soon as
she appeared on the horizon, two circles were distinguished,
one large and whitish, 44° in diameter,
the other smaller, displaying all the colors of the
rainbow. The space between the two circles was
of the deepest azure. At the altitude of 4° they disappeared,
while the meteorological instruments indicated
not the slightest change in the lower regions
of the air. The phenomenon was chiefly remarkable
for the great brilliancy of its colors, and for the
circumstance that, according to the measures taken
with Ramsden’s sextant, the lunar disc was not exactly
in the centre of the halos. Humboldt mentions
likewise having seen at Mexico, in extremely fine
weather, large bands spread along the vault of the
sky, converging toward the lunar disc, displaying
beautiful prismatic colors; and he remarks, that
within the torrid zone, similar appearances are the
common phenomena of the night, sometimes vanishing
and returning in the space of a few minutes,
which he assigns to the superior currents of air
changing the state of the floating vapors, by which
the light is refracted. Between latitude 15° of the
equator, he records having observed small tinted
halos around the planet Venus, the purple, orange,
and violet being distinctly perceptible, which was
never the case with Sirius, Canopus, or Acherner.
In the northern regions solar and lunar halos are
very common appearances, owing to the abundance
of minute and highly crystallized spicula of ice floating
in the atmosphere. The Arctic adventurers frequently
mention the fall of icy particles during a
clear sky and a bright sun, so small as scarcely to
be visible to the naked eye, and most readily detected
by their melting upon the skin.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>BOOK FIRST.</h2>

<h3>SECTION I.</h3>

<p class='pindent'>The broad sun, red, and with softened beams, rose
lazily upon the young earth. The wide sea, unruffled,
heaved to and fro, mirroring in its depths the
new-made canopy of azure and of gold spread by
God’s hand, from limit to limit, over water and land,
and all the stream of ocean. The herbage stood
rank, thick, heavy, tall and motionless; and covered
with vast shade mountain and valley and plain; for
not yet had the revolving seasons, and storms, with
falling rain abraded the soil, and bared rocks, and
worn acclivities; nor the breath of heaven hastened
in its course, circling the earth; nor the poles left
their place to rise and fall, vibrating; but one unending
spring ruled throughout the year. Rivers rolled—unvexed
and noiseless—toward the bosom of their
great mother; and the mountain stream scarce murmured
as it fell, whitening, from sward to sward, to
sleep in some still lake, happy with water-fowl.
Herds of cattle—of horses and of deer, the elephant
and the bison—wandered, uncared for, through fat
pastures, beautiful with flowers; and the lion roamed
at will, and crouched in every dingle, and in every
glen, and took his prey. The air was vocal with
the voice of birds, of birds innumerable, which saluted
with morning hymn the growing day; and the
hum of insects—which all night had drummed in the
drowsy ear of silence—was hushed, and folding their
wings, they slept. It is the primeval age.</p>

<h3>SECTION II.</h3>

<p class='pindent'>Chrr-oo-uh; chrr-oo-uh; chrr-oo-eh-uh; oo-ugh,
oo-ugh; chrr-oo-uh—A white pigeon stood upon the
lowest branch, heavy with foliage, of a noble oak,
planted with creation, and arched his neck, and
drooped his wings, and turned round and round, calling
to his mate. Chrr-oo-uh; chrr-oo-uh; chrr-oo-eh-uh;
oo-ugh; oo-ugh; chrr-oo-uh—And the white
pigeon looked out upon the sea, which rolled inward
with its new voice, deep and hoarse, as it rolls now,
and broke softly upon the glittering strand, just beneath
his feet; and back to the wooded mountains,
which showed blue and misty through the air, capped
with silvery clouds; and beneath the arms of the
forest trees, where the land rose gently from the
shore, carpeted with green and gold, and all colors
of the sun woven into flowers. Chrr-oo-uh; chrr-oo-uh;
chrr-oo-eh-uh; oo-ugh; oo-ugh; chrr-oo-uh—calling
to his mate.</p>

<h3>SECTION III.</h3>

<p class='pindent'>From a deep, embowered grot—half-hidden within
a grove of oranges, and trellised with the woodbine
and the grape, clustering—came a sweet voice, singing;
not with the musical cadence and alliteration,
and returning rhyme of later days, when intellect
refined to weaken, but with the promptings of the
soul, gushing, unmeasured, finding speech as it
might.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Call, call to your mate, happy bird, and she shall
call to you again; but where is he who should call
to me, in this day of joy? Erix, my Erix, rising
like the sun in his strength, with broad shoulders,
and a brow moulded by God! And the glory of his
head, brighter than the beams of the morning; those
curls which I, with merry fingers, have so often
twisted, until they sprang from me with life and
laughter, and clung about his neck, kissingly—why
do they not dance before me, gladdening my sight?
And those arms, like twisted vines, which hold and
give every happiness—why are they not here to receive
me? And those lips, which are so used to
praise me, until I wonder at my own comeliness,
and lose my breath in their thieving—why are they
not here to bless me, with their music so subduing?
And those eyes, so large and deep, those wells of
passion, in which I live a double being, in which I
see my own blushing—why are they not here, to
kindle and to burn? Oh! Erix, my Erix, as flowers
love the earth, as the earth loves the sun, as the sun
loves its Maker, so is my love for thee, most beautiful
and most excellent!”</p>

<h3>SECTION IV.</h3>

<p class='pindent'>And with the singing, came a fair maid, tripping
into the outer air; large, lithe of limb, like the moon
riding in mid-heaven, when seen in her full light,
paling the stars. Her hair fell, unbound, even to her
feet, covering half her shape; and about her waist
was knit a robe of sables, which flowed downward,
and concealed no excellence above the girdle. Her
form was sister to the antelope, and her face, one,
which Phidias would have chiseled for a Juno of
giant make. Her glowing eyes, blue as the ether
above them, rolled liquid as she sang, and bent the
knee, and worshiped, extending her arms, which
showed like wreaths of snow borne upon the wind,
toward the mounting day—not ignorantly, for she
was too near to God in time, to have forgotten him.
Then rising, she also looked upon the sea, smiling
in the sunlight, and loved it; for she was born upon
its shores, and, with life, its roar filled her ears. She
loved it—coming to her, from whence she knew not,
from beyond the reach of space, which to her eye
was bounded by the heavens, that bowed down and
girdled the waters—and enticed, the robe of sables
fell from her, and the glad brine received her, and
mounting, laved all her beauty. Thus swimming,
thus sporting, thus playing with young ocean, now
floating, now dipping beneath his bosom heaving
with great joy. The white pigeon left its perch,
and sought a new rest, even the fair maid’s fair brow,
rising from the wave, and arched its neck, and
drooped its wings, and turned round and round, chrr-oo-uh;
chrr-oo-uh; chrr-oo-eh uh; oo-ugh; oo-ugh;
chrr-oo-uh; calling to its mate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The white pigeon nestled in the grot, and knew
its mistress, and her caress; and when the maid
would have taken it tenderly in her hand, smoothing
its ruffled feathers, it flew upward, cleaving the air
in circles, and descending, lighted upon her wrist,
and pecked at her taper fingers, roseate with health,
and arched its neck, and drooped its wings, and
turned round and round; chrr-oo-uh; chrr-oo-uh;
chrr-oo-eh-uh; oo-ugh; oo-ugh; chrr-oo-uh; calling
to its mate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Call, call to your mate, happy bird, and she shall
call to you again; but, where is he who should call
to me, in this my bridal hour? Erix, my love, my
life, my soul’s sole hope!”</p>

<h3>SECTION V.</h3>

<p class='pindent'>The sound of merry horns, of laughter, and of
shout, came leaping through the wood, and the fair
maid started like a fawn, like a fawn tracked by the
hunter, when it first scents its pursuer in the breeze;
and hastening to the strand, she knit the robe of sables
about her waist, and it fell down as before, concealing
no excellence above the girdle. Fresh from
the wave, she stood gazing, with hope and expectation
her handmaids, who with nimble fingers adorned
her, and covered her all over with tints from the
blushing east. Her hair, long and damp, thick sown
with pearly brine, showed gemmed; and parted lip,
and flashing eye, the very tell-tales of passion, betrayed
the beatings of her heart, her fears and her
desire. When, in an after age, the poet wove this
story into mythologic fable, he called her Venus, the
Aphrodite, born of the foam of the sea; and the
sculptor caught her as she stood, her feet like flocks
of wool, the right advanced, the left raised at the
heel, rushing, moving, white, and fair.</p>

<h3>SECTION VI.</h3>

<p class='pindent'>And now, far within the leafy vista, was seen approaching,
descending toward the strand, a troop of
maidens and young men. Crowned with chaplets
of roses and the fruitful vine, they came on dancing,
to shout and laughter, and the sound of merry horns;
and he who led them was taller than the rest, herculean;
and from his back hung a boar’s hide, and
about his loins were girded the skins of foxes and of
wolves, spoils of the chase. In his hand he held a
bow, which he drew proudly at the sun; elated with
the nearness of his supremest bliss. Child of the
forest, greater than the sun, immortal, thou shall live
when all of matter hath wholly passed away; draw
then, thy bow, aspiring, if thou wilt; it is thy soul,
conscious of its superiority, stirring within thee.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On, on; love gives fleetness to his feet. “Zella,
Zella,” calling to his mate. And again the shout,
the laughter, and the sound of merry horns; and
again, “Zella, Zella,” calling to his mate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Zella called not to him again. Her heart was
upon her tongue, and she could not speak; her
strength had left her knees, and she stood transfixed;
while “Zella, Zella,” sprang from every lip, echoed
through the wood, and died afar off, amid the murmurs
of the sea. Again, “Zella, Zella;” again the
shout, the laughter, and the sound of merry horns;
and Erix clasped the loved one to his breast.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Zella!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Erix!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, may the ruler of the heavens and good
earth so bless me, as I love thee, my soul’s choice!
Closer, closer, my heart of hearts; thus twining, thus
growing, no storm shall divide us; but, with equal
step, we will move right onward through life, and
beyond life, to gather new strength and a new glory,
in a hereafter.”</p>

<h3>SECTION VII.</h3>

<p class='pindent'>The band of youths and fair maids danced around
them, hand in hand, singing, “To the Mighty Giver
of all good, praise. He sends the blossom and the
fruit, praise. From Him come all our joys, praise.
He made the day, and the night, with all her train
of ever-burning fires, the fairest labor of His hand,
praise. The sun is His servant, the moon His
daughter, praise. He gave us the earth, with all its
beauty of hill and valley, of water and of wood,
praised be forever His holy name. Oh, happy, happy
day! oh, happy, happy hour! Open, ye heavens!
and let love from on high descend upon these two,
brooding; that they may live, from generation to
generation, renewed and renewing, to the end of
time. Holy, holy, holy, is this compact instituted
in the beginning. Now are ye of one flesh; hearts
the same, wills the same, desires the same; of one
body, of one mind. Praise Him, praise Him, praise
the Mighty Giver of all good!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then hastening to the sea, they took up water,
briny water, in shells, and poured it upon the lovers,
and baptized them into a new life, and cast their
chaplets upon them and covered them with flowers;
still dancing, still singing: “The divided part has
become old, put it off; the present is bright with
every hope, enjoy it; the future shall be what you
may make it, be not wanting; oh, happy, happy,
happy pair! As ye are, so we would be; ever
drinking draughts of pleasure through each revolving
year.”</p>

<h3>SECTION VIII.</h3>

<p class='pindent'>And now came forth the aged of the tribe, slow
descending from the wood, and embraced them and
blessed them; “Be fruitful and multiply—swear.”
And Erix and Zella stretched out their hands toward
heaven and swore, by the light, and by the orbs of
the air, and by the ocean, far-rounding, illimitable,
infinite, and by the solid earth, and by Him who
moved upon the face of the waters and begat this
glory, to be forever one. “What you receive, I will
receive; what you reject, I will reject; your breath
is my breath, and even as we are now, so death
shall find us; leaving all else to cleave unto each
other.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The dance, the shout, the sound of merry horns,
pointed to the grot, and Erix and Zella led the way.
He, with head erect and willing feet, proud of his
victory; she, with downcast eyes and halting gait,
irresolute, resolved, like a coy maid, half-refusing,
like a wife, wholly trusting, while youth and maiden,
paired, in a long line, came sweeping after. And
now they sway, first to the right then to the left,
with measured step, beating upon the glad earth the
bridal-song.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Receive, receive thy children, Paradise, garden
new found, not lost to us forever.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who are these that come, beautiful with joy?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Receive, receive thy children, Paradise, garden
new found, not lost to us forever.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who are these that knock, pressing to tread upon
holy ground?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thy children, father; thy children, mother;
open wide the gates that they may enter in. Praised
be thy name, oh Adam! praised be thy name, oh
Eve! these are thy offspring, joined as ye were
joined, by the hand of God; open wide the gates
that they may enter in.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The grot received them, echoing; and shout, and
laughter, and the sound of many horns, held riot
over a feast of fruit, and the chase, and water from
the brook, till the day went out and night crept
slowly in, and stars spotted the sky, and the white
pigeon descended nestling, timidly, to its couch,
and arched its neck, and drooped its wings, and
turned round and round; chrr-oo-uh; chrr-oo-uh;
chrr-oo-eh-uh; oo-ugh; oo-ugh; chrr-oo-uh; calling
to its mate—and she, called to him again.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;'>——</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>BOOK SECOND.</h2>

<h3>SECTION I.</h3>

<p class='pindent'>Ten circles have passed; ten circles of the earth
about the sun; what are ten circles to life before the
flood! The night is just yielding to the day, and in
the farthest east streaks of gray light lie floating,
dividing the ocean from the sky. How quiet the
earth is; and seems to breathe, long and deep, in its
huge slumber, not yet awakened. The murmur of
the sea is infinite, ceaseless, and breaks, and returns,
and breaks, in regular cadence upon the shore; ever
speaking the same words—eternity and power. The
sea and silent stars, which look down, twinkling,
from heaven’s pavement, alone are watchful. How
quiet the earth is! The owl sits moping upon her
perch in some tall pine, and the wolf, whose cry,
whetted by hunger, pierced the shades of night,
gorged and reeking, has hastened to his lair. The
dew, like rain, is upon the grass and all herbage, and
hangs, globular, from every leaf. An incense rises,
the incense of the morning, and fills the air; now
known only to the wise and the poor, beloved of
God. Hour most sweet; when day salutes the
night, and night kisses day, to part and meet again.</p>

<h3>SECTION II.</h3>

<p class='pindent'>At such an hour, Erix and Zella shook sleep from
their eyelids and came forth, ready for the chase.
Her hair no longer floated unbound, but, as became
the matron, was twisted into a knot and confined
with strings of coral, fashioned by the hand whose
soft caress she returned with joys unspeakable.
Upon her drooping shoulders, white and bare, rests
a quiver well filled; and a belt of tiny sea-shells interwoven
with fibres of the lichen, crosses transversely
her breast, now full and rounded to completion.
Sandals are upon her feet, and a tunic of
shaggy hide covers her from the waist to the knee;
all else, the morning air, invigorating, embraces.
Thus seen, the poet of an after age, changed his
story, and called her Dian, ruler of the night; and
sang her praises in verse set to the babbling of
brooks, the music of the wood, and sylvan sports.
Erix, large, erect, perfect in manly beauty, with
limbs well knit, proportional, combining activity and
strength, was less incumbered than his mate, and
carried, as his sole weapon, an ashen spear, charred
and hardened at the point by fire. His was the front
of Jove, the pagan, not yet won from mortality by
intellect, or raised above mere matter, to express the
soul’s labors and ambitions. And first, low bending,
rose the morning prayer.</p>

<h3>SECTION III.</h3>

<p class='pindent'>“Hail Father, Creator; Thou who gavest into our
hands the earth, with its fullness; all hail! Thy
children, fashioned after thine own excellence, we
stand, rejoicing. Greater than the earth are we;
greater than the sea, that vast stream which compasses
all land, forever proclaiming thy praises;
greater than the orbs of day and night; greater than
the elements, thy ministers; for thou didst speak
unto our fathers, and didst promise to raise the seed
of Adam higher than the angels. The thunder
serves us, obedient to thy will; and the quick lightning;
and the clouds, pregnant with rain. In the air
we find thy mercies, and every tree, and every
flower speaks of thee. Accept, accept our great
gratitude; and keep us, even as thou keepest all
else.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again low bending, and Erix and Zella, light of
foot, passed onward to the chase.</p>

<h3>SECTION IV.</h3>

<p class='pindent'>They skirt the wood, and narrowly inspect the
dewy grass, to find new foot-prints of beast or heavy
bird, seeking, with returning light, their accustomed
food. No fairy ring, no shape of naiad or of dryad,
no gnome, no sprite, met their pure vision, to turn
them from their way; for not yet had the mind of
man built up a superstition unto itself, and peopled
the clefts of the earth, the water, and the air, giving
to nothingness forms innumerable. Truth was too
near and palpable, to be lost in imagination; to be
moulded and cast anew, so changed as not to know
itself; and poetry, the juggler and soul’s cheat, lay
hid in matter, where God placed it, to be drawn
thence for other purposes than those of error. It
was not until man forgot his origin, that he sought
out a new creator, even Beauty, the prime element
in all God’s works, and so wrought with it, as to
give strange life to all that is, and is not.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The wily hunters, skilled in their life’s trade, turn
on every side, observe the lower boughs, fresh cropped,
imitate the call of birds, the cry of deer, peer
through the thick underwood which stood here and
there in clumps, and plunged into the forest upon a
trail which promised success.</p>

<h3>SECTION V.</h3>

<p class='pindent'>The sylva before the flood! Huge, aspiring, with
arms reaching outward many a rood, each monarch
stood; the traveler and man of science, he whose
name now fills the world, never found, in his many
rounds in search of knowledge, even in southern
climes, such offspring of earth, air, water, and the
sun; and Australia, with its wondrous herbage,
sometimes cloud-capped, stand dwarfed and small to
the life with which God, in his first joy, clothed his
work. The poet, too, and writer of the Comedies,
whose soul was bitter hell, saw not in heaven, nor
beneath, nor in the orb between, a wood so vast, so
majestic, and so beautiful. Trees, the growth of
many a revolving year, lay mouldering; not prostrated
by the tornado, nor driven from their seat by
floods of water and of rock, which leave their track
seamed, as one might plough a furrow in the field,
but fallen through age, and draped with moss of the
liveliest green, softer to the touch than a woman’s
lip. The vine crept from limb to limb, and threw
out its tendrils joyously; now hanging in mid air,
and now, a parasite, twisting about the trunk of
some gnarled oak, adding to strength its sister loveliness;
while flowers, broad and tall, with petals like
masts, and of a hue more delicate than that which
opens to the garish sun, spotted the ground as stars
spot the sky. The air pressed heavy, damp, laden
with aromatic odors, as to one standing beneath the
swelling arches of some old temple, raised in the
middle-age by hands whose labors Michelett has
transferred to historic prose, more lasting than the
stone which was to them a religion and a worship.
No voice broke the general stillness, save the sound
of distant water, floating upon the breathings of the
wood, just reaching the ear, now heard and now
lost, as a maid calling to her lover. Amid such excellence,
the excellence of a primeval age, before
man and the seasons had marred earth’s face, Erix
and Zella hunted.</p>

<h3>SECTION VI.</h3>

<p class='pindent'>The two moved on, like gods, hastening to outrun
the growing light, and to make their sport before
high noon should steal its freshness from their path.
So, long after, but less large, less strong, less fleet,
and less beautiful, did the twin creations of pure
intellect, Apollo and his mate, pursue the boar in
Tempe; while the herdsman who sat afar off, upon
some high rock, watching his wealth, veiled his face
in wonder and in fear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus were three full leagues passed over, through
the windings of the wood; he, crushing the flowers
beneath his feet, she, just bending their drooping
heads, when Erix descried a noble stag standing
upon the bank of a sweet pool, of narrow round,
which, embosomed in the forest, slept peaceful, and
mirrored in its face the moving foliage and the blue
sky above. With head depressed, the deer had
caught his own image in the water, and stood threatening
with mimic war his shadowy antagonist,
returning thrust for thrust. Poor beast! Now strain
the nerve and put forth thy utmost speed, for no
shadows threaten at thy back, but death, with feet
swifter than the wind. With one loud shout the
forest rang, and then, clear as the notes of bugle or
of flute, played to the listening morn, burst forth the
hunter’s song; for not yet had the gin and pit, and
stealth cowardly creeping upon its prey, debased the
chase, and dishonored with cheat and trick man’s
highest sport; but room was given and a chance for
life, to the course before the flood.</p>

<h3>SECTION VII.</h3>

<p class='pindent'>See, the east is glowing with golden-tinted light,
and the morn calls to us with the breath of youth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>See, the incense rises from every dewy leaf; and
the morn calls to us with the breath of youth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The air floats, balmy, o’er hill, and wood, and
lake; and the morn calls to us with the breath of
youth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The spear stands, impatient, by the wall; the bow,
unstrung, lies mourning at the door; while the morn
calls to us with the breath of youth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hark! The horn winds joy, and the echoes laugh,
and leap, and dance—trr, trr, trr, trr, trrwhroo,
trrwhroo—in circles of mad delight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Awake, then, awake; for the horn winds joy, and
the echoes laugh, and leap, and dance—trr, trr, trr,
trr, trrwhroo, trrwhroo—in circles of mad delight;
and the morn calls to us with the breath of youth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now press the foot, and watchful be the eye, for
the spear is in the hand, and the arrow on the string,
and the horn winds joy, and the echoes laugh, and
leap, and dance—trr, trr, trr, trr, trrwhroo, trrwhroo—in
circles of mad delight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Away, and away, in a race against the sun;
while the horn winds joy, and the echoes laugh, and
leap, and dance—trr, trr, trr, trr, trrwhroo, trrwhroo—in
circles of mad delight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of the strong, we are the strongest, and of the
fleet, we are the fleetest; while the horn winds joy,
and the echoes laugh, and leap, and dance—trr, trr,
trr, trr, trrwhroo, trrwhroo—in circles of mad delight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The game flies, scudding athwart the forest path,
while the horn winds joy, and the echoes laugh, and
leap, and dance—trr, trr, trr, trr, trrwhroo, trrwhroo—in
circles of mad delight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The wolf howls defiance, and hastens to his lair;
the deer, suspicious, scents the coming storm; the
lion’s deep growl comes rolling up the glen, while
the horn winds joy, and the echoes laugh, and leap,
and dance—trr, trr, trr, trr, trrwhroo, trrwhroo—in
circles of mad delight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then press the foot, and watchful be the eye; for
the spear is in the hand, and the arrow on the string;
and the horn winds joy, and the echoes laugh, and
leap, and dance—trr, trr, trr, trr, trrwhroo, trrwhroo—in
circles of mad delight; and the morn calls to us
with the breath of youth.</p>

<h3>SECTION VIII.</h3>

<p class='pindent'>With one bound the stag cleared the narrow pool,
and with head erect, his branching antlers resting
upon his back, fled onward; swifter than the wind
that, in winter’s dreary reign, under the stars of cold
December, drives fierce and cutting through the
gorge which, in the farthest north, divides the granite
hills sheer to their base, while the song poured
thickening upon his rear—sounds of victory and pursuit.
Thus, with nostrils wide distended and smoking
flanks, he led his foes through many a double
and straight reach, now holding to the cover of the
wood, and with sure eye, passing beneath gnarled
oaks, and through hanging vines, and boughs interlocked
blacker than night, and now, seeking the
open plain, where the sea rolled inward to find its
limit. There the voice of his pursuers no longer
urged him on, or was lost in that greater voice to
which he had fled as to a refuge; and he rested,
trembling, upon the rim of the ocean, his fetlocks
laved by its flaky foam, and looking out upon it,
sobbing, in search of a safety which the water as
the land denied. So, in the race of life, the unfortunate,
hunted by its ills, with hope crushed out,
stand upon its utmost verge, gazing, and find no joy
beyond, till death strikes them through, to perish and
be forgotten.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Short time was given, for Erix and Zella, side by
side, keeping ever, like fate, to their fixed end, soon
issued from the wood, and with voice and gesture
urged their prey to a new flight. The game, now
driven to his last shift, stilled his coward heart,
turned and stood at bay; but Zella, unwilling thus
to close the morning’s sport, drew an arrow to its
head, and sent the weapon whirring, to glance and
fall far out at sea. Enraged with such acts, the stag
sprang forward, striking on either side; and as Erix,
yielding, strove to take him by the horns, leaped
as far as Apollo’s horses leaped, in that great story
told by the Greek whose song civilized the world.
Like a bolt, winged, he sped through the whistling
air, when Zella, quick turning, with a shaft more
fleet, smote him, mid-way, quite through his bursting
heart. Upon a scented bank, deep within the wood,
mossy, curling over the stream which there, trickling,
smooth, and quiet, hastened to kiss the sea,
the poor beast fell, and groaned his life away; and
the warm sun danced and flickered, as if in very
joy of the beauty it had made, through the tall
trees, and around the climbing vines, and across the
green leaves, and upon the silent water, mocking at
death, and laughing at the spoil which changes but
to create again.</p>

<h3>SECTION IX.</h3>

<p class='pindent'>Erix took Zella’s hand in his and drew her toward
him, nothing loth, till their lips met; then praised
her skill: then pressed again her lips—then praised—then
pressed—while Zella returned the pressure
with many a toy beside. Thus rejoicing in a mutual
love, they sought, with slow step and halting, the
mossy bank, where lay in the sunlight, as if asleep,
the game of late so fleet, and sat them down to rest,
and drink new draughts of pleasure, and count over
the endless good with which Heaven had blessed the
earth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“List, dearest, list! how softly upon the ear, in
sweetest cadence, falls the song of the deep salt
sea!” said Erix.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And the air which hears it, glad to be thus
freighted, floats inward, murmuring, to tell it to the
hills,” said Zella.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And the hills repeat it, whispering.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And the trees catch it; and through the live-long
day, and through the night, over the whole
broad land, play with it, and toss it from bough to
bough, till it has become a language of its own,”
said Zella.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is the voice of this earth.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is the voice of its great joy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And has praised from the beginning, and will
praise unto the end, the hand which made it,” said
Erix.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The sunlight hears it, and moves merrily to the
measure upon every quivering leaf, now leaping
upward to gild the topmost twig, and now chasing
shadows upon the ground beneath.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“See, where it streams through the openings of the
wood, and rests upon this water, smiling! Yes, the
sunlight hears it, and grows brighter with each
draught of a music so divine.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The flowers open to it; and there, upon that
slope, bending gently toward our feet, proud of their
colors penciled by the light, stand thick—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And wonder, and drink deep of the strains which
extol their beauty and their glory, as they extol the
beauty and the glory of all else,” said Erix. “Oh the
song of the sea, of the deep, salt sea, with the air
floating inward, and the hills beyond, and the trees,
and the sunlight, and the flowers thick set upon the
slope, gently bending downward toward our feet, and
this mossy bank, and the pearly brook between—upon
such a morn as this, in such a place as this, Adam
found his Eve.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And upon such a morn as this, in such a place
as this, Eve gave to Adam a love new-created, unknown
to the courts trod by angels’ feet, and which
has raised her daughters above cherub and seraph, to
do and to suffer for their soul’s choice,” said Zella.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Zella!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Erix!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now let the voice of the earth’s joy, the sun, and
herbage speaking, the mossy bank, the flowery slope,
and pearly brook between, bold revel, for a passion,
blushing like the morn, pure as the marble which
grew beneath the hands of Praxitiles, without stain
or blemish, strong as the strongest, weak as the
weakest, even love, is here present, and rules supreme.</p>

<h3>SECTION X.</h3>

<p class='pindent'>Erix and Zella, he bearing upon his broad shoulders
a burden light—the noble game they had
hunted to its death—returned homeward along the
sounding beach, nor made deep foot-prints in the
yielding sand. Unwearied, lithe, in sheer exuberance
of life, they chased the retiring waves, then
turning, fled to be themselves pursued; till young
Ocean, pleased, shook his giant limbs, and like a
lion by a child subdued, rolled at their feet, and
roared, and beat, in his great heart, the measure to
this hymn, which they, alternating, sang.</p>

<hr class='tbk111'/>

<p class='pindent'>“Almighty Lord, Maker of the Earth, in loveliness
beyond compare hast thou fashioned it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Almighty Lord, the maker of our joys, in goodness
beyond compare hast thou fashioned them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thou didst build the hills, and crown them with
thy glory; and they praise forever thy holy name.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thou didst fix the foundations, and form the running
streams; and they praise forever thy holy name.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thou didst plant the forests, and clothe them with
thy beauty; and they praise forever thy holy name.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The plain is thine, with all its life, and, with voices
infinite, praises forever thy holy name.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The air is thine, and within its bosom bears bounties
innumerable, to praise forever thy holy name.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Praise in the pattering rain.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Praise in the gentle dew.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perfume and color.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Form and motion.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All praise forever thy holy name.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thine is the sea, and thou lov’st it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And the sea loves thee, its Maker, in return.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The breezy morn.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The ruddy eve.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The strength of high noon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The quietude of night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All speak of thee, Almighty Lord, the furnisher of
our joys.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And praise forever thy holy name.”</p>

<h3>SECTION XI.</h3>

<p class='pindent'>As Erix and Zella, thus singing, drew nigh unto
the grot where first their joys commingled, to flow
on through life in no divided stream, two boys, the
offspring of their love, came forth to meet them. The
elder, from beneath whose locks, curled and dancing,
reddened with the sun, full many a wild-flower
peeped, bore grapes, ripe, fresh-plucked, and clutching,
pressed the vintage with his hands. The
younger, marching with an uncertain step, just babbling
his first words, caught the generous juice in
his tiny palms, cup-shaped, and offered to his mother,
whose lips sought his, and rested, well content to
drink only of that bliss which God has planted in a
mother’s kiss. Then Erix, casting off his load, took
the elder-born to his arms, and recounted all the
chase—the scent of the perfumed morn, the song,
the flight, the pursuit through wood and open plain,
the halt by the sounding sea, the leap, the fatal shaft,
the crowning death, till the boy shouted, and every
muscle worked in mimic struggle with the mimic
game a-foot; and the white pigeon descended, hovering
o’er the group, and lighted at Zella’s feet, and
arched its neck, and drooped its wings, and turned
round and round; chrr-oo-uh; chrr-oo-uh; chrr-oo-eh-uh;
oo-ugh; oo-ugh; chrr-oo-uh; calling to
its mate.</p>

<h3>SECTION XII.</h3>

<p class='pindent'>And now, sweet friend, who put me to this task,
who won my love, not knowing how or why, come
tread with me the inner-chambers of my house.
This, the portal, is well passed, and other scenes,
and other pictures far, wait eyes which kindle,
though the fire be false, eyes which flow even with
the current of a fictitious wo.</p>

<div><h1><a id='imp'></a>IMPRESSIONS OF ENGLAND IN THE AUTUMN OF 1851.</h1></div>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;'>———</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;font-size:0.8em;font-weight:bold;'>BY FREDERIKA BREMER.</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1.5em;'>———</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is two years since I first found myself in
England. When I was in England in the autumn
of 1849, the cholera was there. A dense, oppressive
atmosphere rested over its cities, as of a cloud pregnant
with lightning. Hearses rolled through the
streets. The towns were empty of people; for all
who had the means of going had fled into the
country; they who had not were compelled to remain.
I saw shadowy figures, clad in black, stealing
along the streets, more like ghosts than creatures of
flesh and blood. Never before had I seen human
wretchedness in such a form as I beheld it in Hull
and in London. Wretchedness enough may be
found, God knows, even in Stockholm, and it shows
itself openly enough there in street and market. But
it is there most frequently an undisguised, an unabashed
wretchedness. It is not ashamed to beg, to
show its rags, or its drunken countenance. It is a
child of crime; and that is perhaps the most extreme
wretchedness. But it is less painful to behold, because
it seems to be suffering only its own deserts.
One is more easily satisfied to turn one’s head aside
and pass on. One thinks, “I cannot help that!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In England, however, misery had another appearance;
it was not so much that of degradation as of
want, pallid want. It was meagre and retiring; it
ventured not to look up, or it looked up with a glance
of hopeless beseeching—so spirit-broken! It tried to
look respectable. Those men with coats and hats
brushed till the nap was gone; those pale women in
scanty, washed-out, but yet decent clothes—it was a
sight which one could hardly bear. In a solitary
walk of ten minutes in the streets of Hull, I saw ten
times more want than I had seen in a ten months’
residence in Denmark.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sun shone joyously as I traveled through the
manufacturing districts; saw their groups of towns
and suburbs; saw their smoking pillars and pyramids
towering up everywhere in the wide landscape—saw
glowing gorges of fire open themselves in the earth,
as if it were burning—a splendid and wonderfully picturesque
spectacle, reminding one of fire-worshipers
of ancient and modern time, and of their altars. But
I heard the mournful cry of the children from the
factories; the cry which the public voice has made
audible to the world; the cry of the children, of the
little ones who had been compelled by the lust of gain
of their parents and the manufacturers, to sacrifice
life, and joy, and health, in the workshops of machinery;
the children who lie down in those beds which
never are cold, the children who are driven and
beaten till they sink insensibly into death or fatuity—that
living death; I heard the wailing cry of the
children, which Elizabeth Barrett interpreted in her
affecting poem; and the wealthy manufacturing districts,
with their towns, their fire-columns, their
pyramids, seemed to me like an enormous temple
of Moloch, in which the mammon-worshipers of
England offered up even children to the burning
arms of their god—children, the hope of the earth,
and its most delicious and most beautiful joy!</p>

<p class='pindent'>I arrived in London. They told me there was nobody
in London. It was not the season in which
the higher classes were in London. Besides which,
the cholera was there; and all well-to-do people,
who were able, had fled from the infected city. And
that indeed might be the reason why there seemed
to me to be so many out of health—why that pale
countenance of want was so visible. Certain it is,
that it became to me as a Medusa’s head, which
stood between me and every thing beautiful and
great in that great capital, the rich life and physiognomy
of which would otherwise have enchanted
me. But as it was, the palaces, and the statues, and
the noble parks, Hampstead and Piccadilly, and Belgravia
and Westminster, and the Tower, and even
the Thames itself, with all its ever-changing life,
were no more than the decorations of a great tragedy.
And when in St. Paul’s, I heard the great
roar of the voice of London—that roar, which, as it
is said, never is silent, but merely slumbers for an
hour between three and four o’clock in the morning—when
I heard that voice in that empty church, where
there was no divine worship, and looked up into its
beautiful cupola, which was filled by no song of
praise, but only by that resounding, roaring voice, a
dark chaotic roar, then seemed I to perceive the
sound of the rivers of fate rolling onward through
time over falling kingdoms and people, and bearing
them onward down into an immeasurable grave!
It was but for a moment, but it was a horrible
dream!</p>

<p class='pindent'>One sight I beheld in London which made me look
up with rejoicing, which made me think “that old
Yggdrasil is still budding.” This was the so-called
metropolitan buildings; a structure of many homes
in one great mass of building, erected by a society
of enlightened men for the use of the poorer working
class, to provide respectable families of that class
with excellent dwellings at a reasonable rate, where
they might possess that which is of the most indispensable
importance to the rich, as well as to the
poor, if they are to enjoy health both of body and
soul—light, air, and water, pure as God created them
for the use of mankind. The sight of these homes,
and of the families that inhabited them, as well as of
the newly-erected extensive public baths and wash-houses
for the same class, together with the assurance
that these institutions already, in the second
year of their establishment, returned more than full
interest to their projectors, produced the happiest
impression which I at this time received of England.
These were to me as seed of the future, which gave
the promise of verdant shoots in the old tree.—</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nevertheless, when I left the shores of England,
and saw thick autumnal fog enveloping them, it was
with a sorrowful feeling for the <span class='sc'>Old</span> world; and
with an inquiring glance of longing and hope, I turned
myself to the <span class='sc'>New</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Two years passed on—a sun-bright, glowing
dream, full of the vigor of life—it was again autumn,
and I was again in England. Autumn met me there
with cold, and rain, and tempest, with the most horrible
weather that can be imagined, and such as I
had never seen on the other side of the globe. But
in social life, everywhere throughout the mental atmosphere,
a different spirit prevailed. There I perceived
with astonishment and joy, there it was that
of spring.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Crystal Palace was its full-blown, magnificent
blossom—and like swarms of rejoicing bees flew
the human throng upon the wings of steam, backward
and forward, to the great world’s blossom;
there all the nations met together, there all manufactures,
there all industry, and every kind of product,
unfolded their flowers for the observation and the joy
of all; a Cactus grandiflora, such as the world had
never till then seen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I perceived more clearly every day of my stay in
England, that this period is one of a general awakening
to a new, fresh life. In the manufacturing districts,
in Liverpool, Manchester, Birmingham, every
where, I heard the same conversation among all
classes; prosperity was universal and still advancing.
That pale countenance of want, which had on
my first visit appeared to me so appalling, I now no
longer saw as formerly; and even where it was seen
stealing along, like a gloomy shadow near to the tables
of abundance, it appeared to me no longer as a
cloud filled with the breath of cholera, darkening the
face of heaven, but rather as one of those clouds over
which the wind and sun have power, and which are
swallowed up, which vanish in space, in the bright
ether.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The low price of grain, the consequence of free-trade,
has produced this change: and it was universally
acknowledged. The only objection I heard
brought against the low price of corn was this,
“The people are become proud and careless; I
have seen great pieces of bread thrown out into the
streets!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet bread alone had not really done all this; a
nobler bread is required for man in order that he may
fully derive the benefit even of the outward material
bread. Nor had free-trade alone done all this
either; there is also another power besides this
which has been operative in that general awakening,
in that wholesome spirit which I perceived in
England.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If this power were to be symbolized by art, it
would present us with a female figure—a beautiful
woman with the child at her breast, is the symbol
which art makes use of, to express human love.
And, perhaps, art is right in so doing. And perhaps
it is the female principle in human nature, which, in
the present new life in England, enables the man’s
hand to accomplish the work; because from the
most remote antiquity, has a male deity been chosen
to represent trade, and navigation and mining, and
all occupation of the earth. But, so says one of the
oldest sagas of the world—when the divine life revealed
itself on the earth, a divine pair came forth.
In a lotus-flower which ascended from the waters
of the Nile, were born at the same time Osiris and
Isis, and together they went forth to bless the
earth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I saw the truth of this saga confirmed by what I
beheld in England. But in speaking of this, I shall
especially linger on the new proofs thereof, in the new
Institutions which promise a more beautiful future
to the human race; not upon the old and insufficient,
however good they may be, but upon the new, because
it is upon the new that my eye has been especially
directed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Let me linger, in the first place, on works of human
love—the female figure with the child at her
breast; because these are they which lay the foundation
of all others.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In Liverpool, I visited the so-called Ragged-Schools—the
schools where are collected from the
streets, vagabond, neglected and begging children,
who are here taught to read and so on—who here
receive the first rudiments of instruction, even in
singing. These schools are, some of them evening,
others day schools, and in some of them, “the
Industrial Ragged-Schools,” children are kept there
altogether; receive food and clothing, and are taught
trades. When the schools of this class were first
established in Liverpool, the number of children who
otherwise had no chance of receiving instruction,
amounted to about twenty thousand. Right-minded,
thinking men, saw that in these children were
growing up in the streets, those “dangerous classes”
of which so much has been said of late times; these
men met together, obtained means to cover the most
necessary outlay of expense, and then, according to
the eloquent words of Lord Ashley, that “it is in
childhood that evil habits are formed and take root;
it is childhood which must be guarded from temptation
to crime;” they opened these ragged-schools
with the design of receiving the most friendless, the
most wretched of society’s young generation—properly,
“the children of rags, born in beggary, and for
beggary.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I visited the Industrial Ragged School for boys,
intended for the lowest grade of these little children,
without parents, or abandoned by them to the influences
of crime. There, I saw the first class sitting
in their rags, upon benches in a cold room, arranging
with their little frost-bitten fingers bristles for the
brush-maker. The faces of the boys were clean:
many of them I remarked were handsome, and almost
universally they had beautiful and bright eyes. Those
little fingers moved with extraordinary rapidity, the
boys were evidently wishful to do their best; they
knew that they by that means should obtain better
clothing, and would be removed to the upper room,
and more amusing employment. I observed these
“dangerous classes”—just gathered up from the
lanes and the kennels, on their way to destruction;
and was astonished when I thought that their countenances
might have borne the stamp of crime.
Bright glances of childhood, for that were you never
designed by the Creator! “Suffer little children to
come unto me.” These words, from the lips of
heaven, are forever sounding on earth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the upper room a great number of boys were
busy pasting paper-bags for various trades, confectioners,
etc. who make use of such in the rapid sale
of their wares; here, also, other boys were employed
in printing upon the bags the names and residences
of the various tradesmen who had ordered them.
The work progressed rapidly, and seemed very
amusing to the children. The establishment, for their
residence and their beds, were poor; but all was
neat and clean, the air was fresh, and the children
were cheerful. The institution was, however, but
yet in its infancy, and its means were small.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Half-a-dozen women in wretched clothes sat in the
entrance-room with their boys, for whom they hoped
to gain admittance into the school, and were now,
therefore, waiting till the directors of the establishment
made their appearance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These gentlemen kindly invited me to be present
at the examination of these mothers. The women
were brought in one at a time, and one and all were
made to tell her history and explain her circumstances.
The examination was carried on with
earnestness and precision. The result of all, however,
was, that there was not one of the women now
present who had a right to the assistance which they
desired. On one or two occasions I could not help
admiring the patience of the directors. Above all,
it seemed to me, that these mothers needed to go to
school even more than their children. When will
people come to regard in all its full extent the influence
of the mother upon the child? When will
people come to reflect on the education of mothers
in its higher sense? My conductor in Liverpool,
Mr. B——, the noble and kind Home Missionary,<a id='r1'/><a href='#f1' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[1]</span></sup></a>
recognized one of these women, and related to me the
history of herself and her husband—a horrible history
of drunkenness, which had almost ended in suicide.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Later in the day I visited the evening school for
girls, also of the ragged class, and heard there a remarkably
sweet and beautiful song. Later still I
accompanied my friendly conductor to a temperance
meeting, held in the same building, and which meets
every Thursday, and where the Missionary was accustomed
to meet and converse with the poorest
brethren of his congregation. The wind blew and
the rain poured down. I was astonished, however,
to see when we entered, that the room was filled
with people who evidently had not much to defend
themselves with from the wind and rain. The
benches were filled both with men and women. It
became crowded and very hot. Mr. B—— opened
the meeting with a speech about the dangers and
consequences of drunkenness, and as he warmed in
his subject he related, yet without mentioning any
name, the history of the mother whom he had this
day seen, beseeching that public charity would take
charge of her son. The assembly, which during the
moral treatise they had just heard had evidently become
somewhat drowsy, woke up at once during
the relation of that story, and when the narrator
arrived at the catastrophe, in which the intoxicated
woman, urged on by the madness of thirst, drank up
half a bottle of oil of vitriol, a general expression of
horror might have been heard, especially from the
lips of the women.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When this relation, which was full of strong vitality,
was ended, Mr. B—— read a poem written by
a working man in praise of temperance, which had
the effect of again lulling the auditors—and myself
even—into an agreeable doze. We all woke up
again, however, when Mr. B——, in a jocular manner,
begged of Mr. J—— to stand up and tell us
something about “that Great Exhibition in London,”
which he had lately been to see. Mr. J—— did not
however, stand up, because Mr. K—— wished to
speak first. Accordingly, being encouraged to do so
by Mr. B——, a stout-built man of about sixty came
forward; he was dressed in coarse, but good clothes,
and had an open countenance, over which played a
smile of humor. He mounted the platform, and was
greeted by the assembly with evident delight. He
related his own history, simple, but full of the warmth
of life, in that strong-grained, wit-interspersed style
of popular eloquence, full of heart and humor at the
same time, which our cultivated orators would do
well to study, if they wish to make a living impression
on the people. He related how he, in his
younger years, never tasted brandy, but he became
a seaman, and began to drink, that he might look
manly among his fellows; how, by degrees, he acquired
the power of swallowing more strong liquor
than any of them all, fell into crime, misery and shame;
how he became converted and again temperate, and
how he had not now for fifteen years tasted spirits,
and had ever since remained in good health and
good circumstances.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This was the substance of his story; but how the
narrative was interspersed with merry conceits,
which excited universal amusement, and with energetic
proverbs—to which Mr. B——, beyond any one
else, gave the highest applause—how cleverly “Mr.
Halcohol” was brought in, and how contemptuously
“the long-necked gentleman, Mr. Halcohol in the
bottle,” was treated, and with how much animation
all this was done and received—must have been
heard to have been fully imagined. The speech
was concluded by recommending “total abstinence”
as the only means for insuring a perfect change of
life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After this there entered a little throng of children
with joyful faces, the same whom I had already
heard sing in the upper room of the house; these
children <a id='were'></a>were the so-called “Band of Hope”—children
who had taken the pledge to abstain from
all strong drinks themselves, and to promote the advancement
of temperance by all the means in their
power, for which they received printed cards containing
their pledge, together with symbolical devices,
proverbs, etc. That little “Band of Hope”
struck up with their clear voices, fresh as the morning,
various songs, among which one in particular,
“The Spindle and Shuttle,” was received with great
delight, all present joining in the chorus. Hymns
and patriotic songs were also sung by “The Band
of Hope,” and now and then the company joined in
with the children. Before the assembly separated
this evening, several went forward and took the
pledge. Among these was a man and his wife.
They took each other by the hand. The woman
with her other hand held her handkerchief over her
left eye; it might be seen, nevertheless, that this eye
was black, probably from the husband’s fist.</p>

<p class='pindent'>What had influenced them to this? What had
operated upon these rude natures?—induced them
to break loose from habits of drunkenness—to turn
from the pleasures of hell to those of heaven? What
was it that had operated on all here so awakeningly,
so livingly? Could it be the discourse they had
heard? could it be the poem in praise of temperance?
Nothing of the kind. I saw them go to
sleep during these. I became sleepy myself. No,
that which operated here so livingly—was the life
itself. It was that living narrative of the unhappy
woman; it was the sailor’s history of his own life,
his battles with “Mr. Halcohol;” it was the songs
of the children, the pure, dewy-fresh voices of the
little “Band of Hope.” All these it was which had
operated upon, which had awakened their minds,
had animated their brains, warmed their hearts; this
it was which had impelled the husband and wife,
hand in hand, to come forward and consecrate themselves
to a new marriage, to a better life. Individual
experience of suffering, of joy, of sin, of conversion,
of love and happiness, must be told, if the
relation is to have any power over the human heart;
life itself must be called into action if we would
awake the dead.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I could not but remark at this meeting, how cordial
and familiar an understanding seemed to exist
between the leader, Mr. B——, and the assembly,
and which arose in part from his own peculiar character,
and in part from his intimate acquaintance
with his hearers. In the same way, his continual
intercourse with those people, and his knowledge of
their every-day life, is an excellent help to him in
giving force to the sermons which he preaches
among them. I shall not forget the effect produced
by his story of the woman and the bottle of
vitriol.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A few days later I visited, with the same friendly
man, some different classes of poor people—namely,
the wicked and the idle; they who had fallen into
want through their own improvidence, but who had
now raised themselves again; and the estimable,
who had honorably combated with unavoidable poverty.
In one certain quarter of Liverpool, it is
that the first class is especially met with. Of this
class of poor in their wretched rooms, with their
low, brutalized expression, I will not speak; companion-pieces
to this misery may be met with every
where. Most of those whom I saw were Irish. It
was a Sunday noon, after divine service. The ale-houses
were already open in this part of the town,
and young girls and men might be seen talking together
before them, or sitting upon the steps.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of the second class I call to mind, with especial
pleasure, one little household. It was a mother and
her son. Her means of support, a mangle, stood in
the little room in which she had lived since she had
raised herself up again. It was dinner-time. A
table, neatly covered for two persons, stood in the
room, and upon the iron stand before the fire was
placed a dish of mashed potatoes, nicely browned,
ready to be set on the table. The mother was waiting
for her son, and the dinner was waiting for him.
He was the organ-blower in a church during divine
service, and he returned whilst I was still there.
He was well dressed, but was a little, weakly man,
and squinted; the mother’s eyes, however, regarded
him with love. This son was her only one, and
her all. And he, to whom mother Nature had
acted as a stepmother, had a noble mother’s heart to
warm himself with, which prepared for him an excellent
home, a well-covered table, and a comfortable
bed. That poor little home was not without its
wealth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As belonging to the third and highest class, I must
mention two families, both of them shoemakers, and
both of them inhabiting cellars. The one family
consisted of old, the other of young people. The old
shoemaker had to maintain his wife, who was lame
and sick, from a fall in the street, and a daughter.
The young one had a young wife, and five little
children to provide for; but work was scanty and
the mouths many. At this house, also, it was dinner-time,
and I saw upon the table nothing but potatoes.
The children were clean, and had remarkably
agreeable faces; but—they were pale; so was also
the father of the family. The young and pretty, but
very pale mother, said, “Since I have come into
this room I have never been well, and this I know—I
shall not live long!” Her eyes filled with tears;
and it was plain enough to see that this really delicate
constitution could not long sustain the effects of
the cold, damp room, into which no sunbeam entered.
These two families, of the same trade, and
alike poor, had become friends in need. When one
of the fathers of the family wanted work, and was
informed by the Home-Missionary who visited them
that the other had it, the intelligence seemed a consolation
to him. Gladdening sight of human sympathy,
which keeps the head erect and the heart
sound under the depressing struggle against competition!
But little gladdening to me would have been
the sight of these families in their cellar-homes, had
I not at the same time been aware of the increase of
those “Model Lodging-Houses,” which may be met
with in many parts of England, and which will
remove these inhabitants of cellars, they who sit in
darkness, into the blessing of the light of life—which
will provide worthy dwellings for worthy
people. But of this I shall speak somewhat later,
in connection with other new institutions for the advancement
of the health, both of body and soul, of—all
classes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For myself, I was well provided for by English
hospitality, and enjoyed an excellent home in the
house of the noble and popular preacher, J. M——.
With him, and his wife (one of these beautiful, motherly
natures, who through a peculiar geniality of
heart is able to accomplish so much, and to render
herself and every thing that is good twofold, in quite
another manner to that of the multiplication-table,
which merely makes two and two into four)—with
them and their family I spent some beautiful days
amid conversation and music. There, in the neighborhood
of their house, I saw also one of those
English parks, whose verdant, carefully-kept sward,
and groups of shrubs and flowers, give so peculiar
and so attractive a charm to the English landscape.
Add to this a river-like sheet of water; swans,
groups of beautiful children and ladies feeding them
on the banks, the song of birds every where amongst
the shrubs; scattered palaces, and handsome country-houses—and
every thing looking so finished, so
splendid, so beautiful and perfect, as if nothing out
of condition, nothing in tatters or shabby was to be
found in the world. Such was the impression produced
by the Prince’s Park, which was laid out by
a wealthy private gentleman, Mr. J——, on the birth
of the Prince of Wales, the eldest son of Queen
Victoria, and thrown open to the public with only
this single admonition exhibited, in large letters, in
various parts of the park, “it is hoped the public
will protect that which is intended for the public
enjoyment.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But I must leave this enchanting Idyll, and hasten
into the manufacturing districts; and, first of all,
to Manchester:</p>

<p class='pindent'>In my imagination Manchester was like a colossal
woman sitting at her spinning-wheel, with her enormous
manufactories; her subject towns, suburbs,
villages, factories, lying for many miles round, spinning,
spinning, spinning clothes for all the people on
the face of the earth. And there, as she sat, the
queen of the spindle, with her masses of ugly houses
and factories, enveloped in dense rain-clouds, as if
in cobwebs, the effect she made upon me was gloomy
and depressing. Yet even here, also, I was to breathe
a more refreshing atmosphere of life; even here was
I also to see light. Free-trade had brought hither
her emancipating spirit. It was a time of remarkable
activity and prosperity. The work-people were
fully employed; wages were good, and food was
cheap. Even here also had ragged-schools been
established, together with many institutions for improving
the condition of the poor working-classes.
In one of these ragged-schools the boys had a perfectly
organized band of music, in which they played
and blew so that it was a pleasure—and sometimes
a disadvantage, to hear them. The lamenting “cry
of the children” was no longer heard from the factories.
Government had put an end to the cruelties
and oppressions formerly practiced on these little
ones by the unscrupulous lust of gain. No child
under ten years old can now be employed in the
factories, and even such, when employed, must of
necessity be allowed part of the day for school.
Every large factory has now generally its own
school, with a paid master for the children. The
boys whom I saw in the great rooms of the factories
and with whom I conversed, looked both healthy
and cheerful.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Two ideas were impressed upon my mind at this
place: how dangerous it is, even amid a high degree
of social culture, to give one class of men unrestrained
power over another; and how easily a free
people, with a powerful public spirit, and accustomed
to self-government, can raise themselves out
of humiliating circumstances. This spirit has done
much already in England, but it has yet more to do.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Upon one of those large, gloomy factories in Manchester,
I read, inscribed in iron letters, “<span class='sc'>The
Great Beehive</span>;” and in truth, a good name for
these enormous hives of human industrial toil, in
which people have sometimes forgotten, and still
forget, that man is any thing more than a working-bee,
which lives to fill its cell in the hive, and die.
I visited several of these huge beehives. In one of
them, which employed twelve hundred work-people,
I saw, in a large room, above three hundred
women sitting in rows winding cotton on reels.
The room was clean, and so also were all the women.
It did not appear to be hard work; but the
steadfastly-fixed attention with which these women
pursued their labor seemed to me distressingly wearisome.
They did not allow themselves to look up,
still less to turn their heads or to talk. Their life
seemed to depend upon the cotton thread.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In another of these great beehives, a long, low
room, in which were six hundred power-looms, represented
an extraordinary appearance. What a
snatching to and fro, what a jingling, what an incessant
stir, and what a moist atmosphere there was
between floor and ceiling, as if the limbs of some
absurd, unheard-of beast, with a thousand arms, had
been galvanized! Around us, from three to four
hundred operatives, women and men, stood among
the rapid machinery watching and tending. The
twelve o’clock bell rung, and now the whole throng
of work-people would go forth to their various mid-day
quarters; the greatest number to their respective
dwellings in the neighborhood of the factory. I
placed myself, together with my conductor, in the
court outside the door of the room, which was on
lower ground, in order that I might have a better
view of the work-people as they came out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Just as one sees bees coming out of a hive into
the air, two, three, or four at a time—pause, as it
were, a moment from the effects of open air and
light, and then with a low hum, dart forth into space,
each one his own way, so was it in this case. Thus
came they forth, men and women, youths and girls.
The greater number were well dressed, looked
healthy, and full of spirit. In many, however, might
be seen the expression of a rude life; they bore the
traces of depravity about them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As labor is now organized in the factories at Manchester,
it cannot easily be otherwise. The master-manufacturer
is not acquainted with his work-people.
He hires spinners; and every spinner is master of a
room, and he it is who hires the hands. He is the
autocrat of the room, and not unfrequently is a severe
and immoral one. The operatives live in their
own houses, apart from every thing belonging to the
master-manufacturer, with the exception of the raw
material.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the country it is otherwise; there the master-manufacturer
may be, and often is, a fatherly friend
and guardian of his people. And where he is so, it
is in general fully acknowledged. The character
which each manufacturer bears as an employer, even
in Manchester, is perfectly well known. People
mention with precision the good, the worthless, or
the wicked master. I visited factories belonging to
some of these various characters, but perceived a
more marked difference in the manners and appearance
of the masters themselves, than in the appearance
and condition of the work-people. At the
present moment the difference could not be very
perceptible, because the general demand for hands
causes the circumstances of the lower classes to be
generally good. But, as before remarked, the patriarchal
connection between master and servant, with
its good, as well as its evil consequences, no longer
exists in the manufacturing towns of England. Employer
and employed stand beside each other, or
rather opposed to each other, excepting through the
requirements of labor. The whole end and aim of
the Manchester manufacturer—when he is not subjected
to machinery, and lives merely as a screw, or
portion of it—is, to get out of Manchester. He spins
and makes use of all means, good or bad, to lay by
sufficient money to live independently, or to build
himself a house at a distance from the smoky, restless
town, away from the bustle—away from the
throng of restless, striving work-people. His object
is to arrive at quiet in the country, in a comfortable
home; and having attained this object, he looks upon
the noisy, laboring hive, out of which he has lately
come, as a something with which he has no concern,
and out of which he is glad to have escaped
with a whole skin. Such is the case with many—God
forbid that we should say, with all!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Two subjects of conversation occupied the people
of Manchester very much at this time. The one
was the question—a vital question for the whole of
England—of popular education. The people of
Manchester had begun to take the subject into serious
consideration, and had come to the conclusion
that there might at once be adopted a simple system
of education by which, as in the United States, every
one should receive in the people’s school practical
and moral instruction, and that religious instruction
should be left for the home or for the Sunday teaching.
The willingness to thus act in concert which
has been shown by the clergy of the Established
Church in Manchester, is a good omen to the various
religious sects united in this work. All things
considered, it seems to me that there is at this moment
in England the most decided movement toward
a new development, a new life as well in theoretic
as in practically popular respects; and it is more apparent
in the Established Church than in any other
religious body.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The second great subject of conversation, as well
in Manchester as in Liverpool, was Queen Victoria’s
expected visit. The Queen had announced
her intention of visiting the great towns of the manufacturing
districts, in company with Prince Albert,
in the middle of the month, and they were accordingly
expected in a few days. Several of these
towns had never before seen a crowned head within
their walls, and this, in connection with the great
popularity of the Queen, and the liking and the love
which the people have for her, had perfectly enchanted
the inhabitants of Manchester. They were
preparing to give a royal reception to their lofty
guests. Nothing could be too magnificent or too
costly in the eyes of the Manchester people which
could testify their homage. The whole of the district,
now that the Queen was expected, was said to
be “brimful of loyalty,” and the whole of England
was at this time, both in heart and soul, monarchical.
Opposition against the royal family exists no
longer in England; the former members of this opposition
had become converted. On all hands there
was but one voice of devotion and praise. Wonderful!
yes, incomprehensible, thought I, when I was
informed that the Queen had requested not long since
to have a grant from Parliament of 72,000<span class='it'>l.</span> for the
erection of new stables at her palace of Windsor,
and the same year 30,000<span class='it'>l.</span>, for Prince Albert to repair
his dog-kennels, and now, again, just lately,
17,000<span class='it'>l.</span> for the erection of stables at a palace which
the Queen has obtained for her eldest son, and of
which he will take possession on attaining his
majority. Thus 119,000<span class='it'>l.</span> for stables and dog-kennels.</p>

<p class='pindent'>What? 119,000<span class='it'>l.</span> for stables and dog-kennels; for
the maintenance of fine horses and dogs, and that at
a time when Ireland is perishing of hunger or emigrating
in the deepest distress; when even in England
so infinitely much remains to be done for humanity,
so much untold good might be effected for
the public with this sum. Queen Elizabeth was
accustomed to say, that she considered her money
best put out when it was in the pockets of her subjects,
and she scorned to desire any great project for
her own pleasure. Queen Victoria desires, year
after year, immense grants for her stables and kennels;
desires this of her people, and yet, for all this,
is homage paid to her—is she loved and supported by
the people in this extraordinary manner! Parliament
grumbles, but consents to all that the Queen
desires, fully consents without a murmur, because it
loves her. Such projects would otherwise be dangerous
to the power of the monarch. Such projects
overturned the throne of Louis Philippe—have undermined
many thrones. But the light foot of this
Queen—a well-beloved little foot it ought to be—dances
again and again on the brink of the dangerous
abyss, and it gives not way. But how is this possible?
What is it that makes this Queen so popular,
so universally beloved by the people, spite of the desire
for stables and dog-kennels, unnecessary articles
of luxury, when hundred thousands of her subjects
are in want even of the necessaries of life; want
even the means to secure a home and daily bread?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus I asked, and thus they replied to me:</p>

<p class='pindent'>The English people wish that their royal family
should live with a certain degree of state. They are
fond of beautiful horses and dogs themselves, and it
flatters the national pride that the royal personages
should have such, and should have magnificent dwellings
for them. The character of the Queen, her domestic
and public virtues, and the influence of her
example, which is of such high value to the nation,
causes it to regard no sacrifice of money as too great
for the possession of such a Queen. England is
aware that under the protection of the throne, under
the shadow of the sceptre of this Queen, and the
stability which it gives to the affairs of the kingdom,
she can in freedom and peace manage her own internal
concerns, and advance forward on the path of
democratic development and self-government, with
a security which other nations do not possess.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hence it is that the reigning family now upon the
English throne presents a spectacle extraordinary
upon this throne, or upon any throne in the world.
The Queen and her husband stand before the people
as the personation of every domestic and public virtue!
The Queen is an excellent wife and mother;
she attends to the education of her children, and
fulfills her duties as sovereign, alike conscientiously.
She is an early riser; is punctual and regular in great
as well as in small things. She pays ready money
for all that she purchases, and never is in debt to any
one. Her court is remarkable for its good and beautiful
morals. On their estates, she and Prince
Albert carry every thing out in the best manner, establish
schools and institutions for the good of the
poor; these institutions and arrangements of theirs,
serve as examples to every one. Their uprightness,
kindness, generosity, and the tact which they under
all circumstances display, win the heart of the nation.
They show a warm sympathy for the great interests
of the people, and by this very sympathy are they
promoted. Of this, the successful carrying out of
free-trade, and the Exhibition in the Crystal Palace,
projected in the first instance by Prince Albert, and
powerfully seconded by the Queen, furnish brilliant
examples. The sympathies of the Queen are those
of the heart as well as of the head. When that noble
statesman, the great promoter of free-trade, Sir
Robert Peel, died, the Queen shut herself in for
several days, and wept for him as if she had lost a
father. And whenever a warm sympathy is called
forth, either in public or in private affairs, it is
warmly and fully participated by Queen Victoria and
Prince Albert.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In confirmation of this opinion regarding Queen
Victoria and Prince Albert, which I heard every
where, and from all parties in England, a number of
anecdotes of their life and actions were related to me,
which fully bore it out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This universal impression, universally produced
by the sovereign, who, properly speaking, can govern
nothing—because it is well known that the monarch
of England is merely a nominal executor of the
wishes of the people, a hand which subscribes that
which the minister lays before it in the name of the
people; this great power, in a Queen, is without
any political power.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Monarchs and their people no longer bear the same
relation to each other as in the time when, for example,
Charles the Ninth put forth his demands, with
the addition,—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do it, and be off with you!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This injunction to do a thing, and then take themselves
off, can no longer be given to the people by
the King, but by reason. The people have arrived
at years of discretion, and the monarch is the executor
of their laws and their wishes. He is so in
England, it is said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From Manchester I traveled to Birmingham. I
saw again the land of the fire-worshipers, their
smoking altars, in tall columns and pyramids, towering
above the green fields; saw again the burning
gulfs yawning in the earth, and, saw them now with
unmixed pleasure. I heard no longer, amid their
boiling roar, the lamenting cry of the children; I
heard and saw them now only as the organs of the
public prosperity, and rejoiced over them as proofs
of man’s power over fire and water, over all the
powers of nature; the victory of the gods over the
giants!</p>

<p class='pindent'>In Birmingham I visited a steel-pen manufactory,
and followed from room to room the whole process
of those small metal tongues which go abroad over
all the world, and do so much—evil, and so much
good; so much that is great, so much that is small;
so much that is important, so much that is trivial. I
saw four hundred young girls, sitting in large, light
rooms, each with her little pen-stamp, employed in
a dexterous and easy work, especially fitted for women.
All were well dressed, seemed healthy and
cheerful, many were pretty: upon the whole, it was
a spectacle of prosperity which surpassed even that
of the mill-girls in the celebrated factories of Lowell,
in America.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Birmingham was at this time in a most flourishing
condition, and had more orders for goods than it
could supply, nor were there any male paupers to
be found in the town; there was full employment
for all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In Birmingham I saw a large school of design.
Not less than two hundred young female artists studied
here in a magnificent hall or rotunda, abundantly
supplied with models of all kinds, and during certain
hours in the week, exclusively opened to these female
votaries of art. A clever, respectable, old woman,
the porter of the school-house, spoke of many
of these with especial pleasure, as if she prided herself
on them in some degree.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I saw in Birmingham a beautiful park, with hot-houses,
in which were tropical plants, open to the
public; saw also a large concert-room, where twice
in the week “glees” were sung, and to which the
public were admitted at a low price: all republican
institutions, and which seem to prosper more in a
monarchical realm than in republics themselves.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I met with a surprise in Birmingham; that is to
say, I was all at once carried back fifteen centuries
into the Syrian desert of Chalsis, and there lived a
life so unlike Birmingham and Birmingham-life, that
just for the sake of contrast, it was very refreshing.
The thing was quite simple in itself, inasmuch as
one evening I accompanied an amiable family, who
resided in Birmingham, to a lecture, which was
given by a young, gifted preacher, on the old Church-father,
Saint Jerome (Hieronymus.)</p>

<p class='pindent'>The subject of the lecture, which was extempore,
and delivered with much ease and perspicuity, was
evidently not intended to recommend to his auditors,
but rather to repel them from an ascetic and contemplative
life. Saint Jerome was delineated as a
noble fool, a curiosity in human nature, and was to
be deplored as a sacrifice to perverted reason, by no
means to be imitated. The true end of humanity
was not to be attained by flying from city life, and
burying one’s self in a desert for study and self-mortification;
that end was rather to be attained in the busy
city, than in the isolated existence of the wilderness;
and so on. Such was the lecturer’s moral. But upon
me his arguments made an impression considerably
antithetical to that which he intended. I saw this
warrior of the third century devoured by a burning
thirst of light and knowledge, of purity for his whole
being; saw him wander out, seeking the wells of
life; saw him, separating from the agreeable circles
of city existence, roam on amid catacombs and the
tombs of martyrs; saw him seeing in Gaul, and on
the Rhine, and there finding—Christianity. Saw
him there, after being baptized, with his Bible under
his arm, retire into the deserts of Syria, and there,
in the burning sands of Chalsis, bury himself for a
number of years, amid exegetic studies and severe
deeds of penance. I heard him, even at the time that
he, according to his own words, “watered his couch
with his tears,” and while he was given over, and
regarded as a fool by his friends, still reproach those
friends for having chosen the worse part, that of the
life of enjoyment in the city, and break forth in transport,
“O! silent wildernesses, flower-strewn by Jesus
Christ! O! wild solitudes, full of his spirit!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I saw him, after his conflict was accomplished, go
forth out of the desert with his Bible, enter Rome
publicly, and unsparingly chastise the crimes of the
proud city. I saw the haughty ladies of Rome first
start, then bow themselves to the severe judgment
of the teacher; saw Marulla and Paula renounce the
dissipated life of Rome, and follow the preacher;
found convents and Christian institutions in accordance
with his views; saw him grow in the combat
with the spirit of the age, till he stood as a founder
of the greatest power on earth—that of the Christian
Church. The <span class='it'>fool</span>, who had buried himself in the
sands of Syria, and done battle with himself during
solitary days and nights.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ah! this fool, this glowing sun of the desert, as he
now stood forth to view, through the veil of fifteen
centuries, grew greater and greater in my eyes, till,
finally, he expanded himself over the whole of
Birmingham, with all its factories, workshops,
steel-pens, and the like, as a colossus above an
ant-hill.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Birmingham is almost entirely of the class of what
are called Chartists; that is, advocates of universal
suffrage. They are this, through good and through
evil; and the resistance which their just desire to be
more fully represented in the legislative body has
met with from that body, has brought them more and
more into collision with the power of the state, more
and more to base their demands in opposition, even
to the higher principles of justice; for they overlook
the duty of rendering themselves worthy of the
franchise by sound education. But the fault here, in
the first place, was not theirs. Growing up amid
machinery and the hum of labor, without schools,
without religious or moral worth; hardened by hard
labor, in continual fight with the difficulties of life,
they have moulded themselves into a spirit little in
harmony with life’s higher educational influences,
the blessings of which they had never experienced.
Atheism, radicalism, republicanism, socialism of all
kinds will and must flourish here in concealment
amongst the strong and daily augmenting masses of
a population, restrained only by the fear of the still
more mighty powers which may be turned against
them, and by labor for their daily needs, so long as
those powers are sufficing. And perhaps the Americans
are right where they say, in reference to this
condition of things;—“England lies at our feet—England
cannot do without our cotton. If the manufactures
of England must come to a stand, then has
she a popular convulsion at her door.” Perhaps it
may be so; for these hosts of manufacturing workmen,
neglected in the beginning by society, neglected by
church and state, look upon them merely as exacting
and despotic powers; and in strict opposition to them,
they have banded together, and established schools
for their own children, where only the elements of
practical science are admitted, and from which religious
and moral instruction are strictly excluded.
In truth, a volcanic foundation for society, and
which now, for some time past, has powerfully
arrested the attention of the most thinking men of
England.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But into the midst of this menacing chaos light has
already begun to penetrate with an organizing power;
and over the dark profound hovers a spirit which can
and will divide the darkness from the light, and prepare
a new creation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From Birmingham I traveled, on the morning of
the 4th of October, by a railway to Leamington, and
thence alone in a little carriage to Stratford-on-Avon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For over half a century after Goldsmith’s death, the
world continued in a state of uncertainty concerning
his writings and himself. The greater part of the
task-work he had performed for the booksellers was
unknown, and Oliver spoken of, in a traditionary
sort of way, as the author of the Vicar of Wakefield
and the Deserted Village, and a man of laughable
eccentricities. The majority of his readers—and no
poet had more of them or enjoyed a wider English
popularity—never thought he was other than an
Englishman; and those who knew the country of
his birth differed about the place of it—some asserting
he was born at Lissoy, in Westmeath, and
others contending for other localities. Even Dr.
Johnson, who has set down his native place—Pallas,
in Longford—correctly in his epitaph, makes a mistake
of three years in his age. All this is remarkable
of the cotemporary of Johnson—one who ranked
with that literary colossus in his time and was so
closely connected with Burke, Reynolds, Percy and
the other celebrities of that period. Resembling, in
some measure, Butler, in the obscurity of his personal
history and the popularity of his works, Goldsmith
seemed to be vaguely merging into the Vicar
of Wakefield, or the Good Natured Man—just as the
poet of the Restoration had come to be confounded
with his Roundhead hero—when Prior’s life of him,
twenty years ago, first threw a fair light upon the
past; indicated the great mass of his writings (poorly
compensated, anonymous and plagiarized, in his life-time,)
and cleared away a large amount of the misconceptions
and fallacies that had been gathered
about his fame.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There has hardly been any author in modern
times, or perhaps in the ancient, whose personal
character contrasts—is made to contrast—so much
with the genuine celebrity he has achieved. He
would seem to have been laughed at a good deal,
and treated with a want of consideration and respect,
even by those who loved him and wept at his
death; and the impression generally conveyed is,
that his manners were uncouth and his conversation
ridiculous. Those who have helped to create such
a character for Oliver, think they have compounded
with their consciences when they have admitted he
was a charming writer, and a simple, honest soul,
who had no harm in him, and always meant well.
Nevertheless, but one half of their portrait can be
received. There were no such violent contrarieties
in the elements that went to compose Oliver Goldsmith.
His biographers—to make the most lenient
estimate of them—knew him imperfectly and found
it much easier to produce their effects by glaring
contrasts than by the patient and loving discrimination
due to the truth of every man’s character—especially
that of a man like Goldsmith—so marked by
peculiarities of education, and so severely tried by
circumstances.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The literary character is sure to suffer, more or
less, in contact with society. Men of letters who
spend half their time with the dead are not exactly
the people to be <span class='it'>au fait</span> of all the ways of the living;
and have not always the good sense of Thomas
Baker, who, for that very reason, refused, long ago,
to be introduced to the Earl of Oxford and the polished
people of his acquaintance. They generally
offend against the conventions and are not pardoned
in their biographies, which are sometimes writ by
men of the world, and which, when even written by
authors, who may be supposed capable of sympathizing
more with the literary character, still show
how the jealousies and prejudices of the craft will
stand in the way of honest criticism. A man’s
character depends very much on his historians—and
Goldsmith, a literary adventurer, a bookseller’s hack,
and an Irishman, was particularly—perhaps, necessarily—unfortunate
in his.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There have been crowds of distinguished literary
men whose peculiarities were almost as much ridiculed
as those of Goldsmith, but who have found a
more dignified appreciation, by virtue of fairer biographers.
Socrates was laughed at more than any
man in Athens. But his immortal pupil has rescued
his fame from those wits and satirists who used to
loiter about the porches, and go, of a morning, to applaud
the Clouds of Aristophanes. Socrates was an
ugly little man—in the midst of the fine-faced men
of Attica—generally threadbare and slovenly; and
even Plato has been obliged to allow that his honored
master was like an apothecary’s gallipot, painted
outside with grotesque figures, but containing balm
within. He was as much laughed at as Goldsmith;
but nobody can think Socrates a laughable old fellow.
There was the Emperor Julian. When he
sojourned at Antioch, he was ridiculed and lampooned
by the citizens for his careless dress and
beard, and his simple manners. Whereupon, instead
of treating them as Sulla did those facetious
Greeks who said “his face was a mulberry sprinkled
with meal,” the philosophic apostate wrote a book
against them, called “Misopogon,” in which he pleasantly
satirized himself for his literary peculiarities,
justified his critics, and happily admitted that he did
not, indeed, resemble in any thing those witty and
fashionable people who made merry at his expense.
If these Antiochans were Julian’s biographers, he
should cut but a silly figure in the eyes of posterity.
As it is, he has hardly fared much better in another
point of view. La Fontaine was voted intolerably
stupid in society. The gay Parisians said he
merely vegetated—and he was called the Fable
Tree—bringing forth fables! Poor Burns complained
that though, when he wished, he could make himself
“beloved,” he could not make himself “respected.”
He confessed that he wanted discretion—was
prone to a <span class='it'>lapsus linguæ</span>, and very apt to offend
the sense of the society he was in—in this,
somewhat like Goldsmith. We could cite a score
of instances showing that famous men have been
barely tolerated in society and very much exposed
to the ridicule of it. But their biographers have
done their better qualities justice, and they are not
remembered in any remarkable degree in connection
with the peculiarities which excited the satire of
their cotemporaries.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A great many things worked unfavorably for
Goldsmith. His face was very plain-favored in expression,
he spoke with a brogue and hesitated a
little in his utterance. In his nature he was shy, and
his manners in society had all the simplicity and unguarded
impulse of his earlier years. Such a man,
living in comparative retirement, might have passed
through the world without any disparagements.
But Goldsmith was thrown upon the great stage of
London, and into the society of the most fastidious
critics and gentlemen of the age. Here his ordeal
was a severe one—as the result showed. Boswell,
Hawkins, Cumberland, Northcote, Thrale and the
rest of those who either wrote memoirs or furnished
reminiscences of our author, have proved how
little they could sympathize with the plain, blunt
Irishman—who was only a simple child of nature
and of genius.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Among those who have most contributed to lessen
the prestige of Goldsmith’s name was James Boswell,
Dr. Johnson’s literary henchman and biographer.
In all that Boswell writes of Oliver he exhibits
his desire to disparage him. It is true he sometimes
expresses partiality for Goldsmith’s conversation.
But he, doubtless, intends this as a show of
frankness to obtain the more easy credence for his
general opinions of the poet. One great cause of
this feeling on Boswell’s part was his reverent attachment
to the fame of Dr. Johnson, and his jealousy
of any one who came or seemed to come into
rivalry with that Ursa Major of the British literary
firmament. Boswell had the little soul of a parasite,
and always felt offense at any exhibition of independence
toward Johnson—such having the effect
of rebuking his own absurd obsequiousness. Goldsmith,
though the easiest and kindliest of men, still
kept up that frank, irrespective manliness of disposition
which belongs to genius, and could not sympathize
with Boswell’s extreme notions of worship.
The poet must have felt the folly and impoliteness
of trumpeting Johnson in season and out of season—often
in presence of better men than the lexicographer—and
must have been offended with it, too. On
one occasion, indeed, he said to Boswell, with his
usual point and good sense—“Sir, you are for making
a monarchy of that which should be a republic.”
He respected Dr. Johnson, but never bowed down
to him, nor to any one else. And the son of a Scottish
lord, who venerated on all-fours, could not forgive
the poor Irish scholar for standing erect in presence
of the grim idol—as Johnson too often was, in
his austere moods. Along with all this, Boswell
probably knew very well the opinion which Goldsmith
had of himself. In conversation with some
one who called Boswell a Scotch cur, Goldsmith
remarked—“Not so—he is only a Scotch bur: Tom
Davies (the publisher) threw him at Johnson and he
sticks to him.” A saying which, of course, found
its way to the <span class='it'>bur’s</span> ears. All these things are sufficient
to account for the animus palpably exhibited
against Goldsmith in Boswell’s Life of Johnson.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When his book appeared, he was sharply and universally
condemned for his treatment of the dead
writer. Lord Charlemont expressed his indignant
astonishment how James Boswell could affect to
undervalue a man of such genius and popularity.
Burke said to Lady Crewe, on the subject—“What
sympathy could you expect to find, my dear madam,
between an Irish poet and a Scotch lawyer?”
Wilkes swore two such characters were moral antipodes.
Sir Joshua Reynolds, who knew Goldsmith
like a brother, and who had heard from report
how Boswell meant to depict the poet, remonstrated
earnestly with him on the subject before the biography
of Johnson came out. Bishop Percy, Mr.
Stephens, Mr. Malone and others denied that Goldsmith
was guilty of the fooleries and grimaces and
unworthy feelings attributed to him by Boswell, and
protested against the low estimate he had made of
Oliver’s genius and character. And yet with all
Boswell’s earnestness in the attempt to lessen Goldsmith,
it is remarkable how little he is really able to
injure him in the long run. He has created an unfavorable
impression of the poet’s manners it is true;
but this is wearing away; and the fact is, that, not
only the silly Boswell himself, but the austere doctor
whom he delighted to honor, and wrote every thing
to glorify, seems to be more reflected on than Goldsmith,
in most things that have been recorded to the
disparagement of the latter in connection with
Johnson.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One of Boswell’s first anecdotes of Johnson and
Goldsmith will show the paltry, parasitical spirit in
which he was in the habit of making his notes and
comments. They three had been supping at the
Mitre tavern, when Johnson got up to go home and
take tea with his blind dependent, Miss Williams.
“Dr. Goldsmith,” says Bozzy, “being a privileged
man, got up to go with him, strutting away and
calling to me, with an air of superiority, like that of
an esoteric over an exoteric disciple of a sage of antiquity,
‘I go to Miss Williams.’ ” He says he
envied this “mark of distinction,” but soon had the
same honor himself! Boswell always betrays himself.
For, without a grain of Oliver’s genius, he
shows himself to be as thoughtless and absurd as he
would have us think the poet to have been. If the
latter did really exhibit any thing like exultation on
the occasion alluded to—the canny Scot mistook it;
he could not enter into the humorous vein of the
author of the Citizen of the World, who never let
any opportunity of pleasantry of any kind escape
him, and who, doubtless, with a playful impulse,
would, slily and aside, for Boswell’s behoof, put on
a comic air of loftiness, at the idea of his own privilege.
Such little <span class='it'>traits</span> were very characteristic of
Oliver Goldsmith, at all periods of his life; and neither
his own dignity nor that of any one else was
much thought of, whenever his funny “Cynthias of
the minute” came across him. With all his respect
for Dr. Johnson, he had still—though Boswell does
not seem to admit it—a very strong sense of what
was odd, petulant and <span class='it'>grandiose</span> in the doctor’s
manners, and could sport with it, too, to the bear’s
face, with a rare and child-like temerity. For instance,
once at Jack’s Coffee-house, where the pair
were dining on rumps and kidneys, Johnson said—“These
rumps are pretty things; but a man must
eat a great number of them.” Goldsmith assented
with pleasantry, and then, under the easy, unawed
impulse of his nature, and carried away by the
thought that he was not at his dreary desk, but at
dinner with his friend, pushed on with—“But how
many of them would go to the moon?” Johnson
had, doubtless, said such small matters did not <span class='it'>go far</span>—a
common expression, which would have provoked
Oliver’s pun—though the story says nothing
of this.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To the moon?” replies Johnson; “I think that
exceeds your calculation.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not at all, sir,” cries Goldie—looking ludicrously
prepense, at the terrible, grave face opposite—“I
think I could tell.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, sir,” rejoined Ursa Major; whereupon
the other comes out with:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One, if it was long enough!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Johnson growled angrily, and said he was a fool
to provoke such an answer. Not a fool, however,
but a solemn bear, whose very grimness, contrasted
with the absurdity of the solution, was Goldsmith’s
irresistible temptation. We must, in fact, justify
Oliver’s fun—though we did not see Johnson’s face.
The thing was laughter-compelling. Goldsmith
had no undue feeling of deference in his nature at
all, though he used certainly to go on all-fours to
amuse the children. His irrespective and somewhat
careless humor often irritated Johnson, who
generally supped full of flattery.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Doctor,” said Johnson one day, “I have not
been quite idle; I lately made a line of poetry.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Instead of holding up his hands reverently, Goldsmith
cried out with his customary levity—“Come,
sir, let us hear it; we will try and put a bad one
to it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, sir,” replied the petted monster, drawing in;
“I have forgotten it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Boswell’s attempts to depreciate Goldsmith are
blunderingly made. He always admits enough to
betray his own unfair spirit. Johnson having had
in 1767, an interview with the king in the library of
St. James’s Palace, the thing was greatly talked
of. Boswell says, that once at the house of Sir
Joshua Reynolds, the doctor was, by request (the
henchman’s of course), induced to repeat the circumstances
of the meeting, and that during the recital,
Goldsmith was observed to be silent and <span class='it'>inattentive</span>.
He says, the latter was envious of Johnson’s
luck, but he goes on to state that at last the frankness
and simplicity of his nature prevailed, he advanced
to Johnson and told him, he acquitted himself
admirably—that he (Goldsmith), “should have
bowed and stammered through the whole of it.” No
sign of any very deadly envy in all this, surely.
Johnson himself, though he mostly made a point
of defending Goldsmith against attacks, could not
help feeling a little pique and jealousy toward the
wit, who never refrained from arguing the matter
with him, comically or keenly as he saw fit. Johnson
was truculent at times, and would speak rudely
to Goldsmith in company. One of the surly moralist’s
formulas, whenever Goldsmith would say,
“I don’t see that,” was—“Nay, my dear sir, why
can you not see what everybody else sees?” On
such occasions, Goldsmith’s independence, or want
of tact was against him. Johnson at times, used to
put him down in this way. During an argument,
Goldsmith having been several times contradicted,
“sat in restless agitation,” says the veracious Boswell,
“from a wish to get in and shine.” No easy
matter when Johnson was cloudy. “Finding himself
excluded,” he goes on—“he had taken his hat to go
away, but remained for some time with it in his
hand. Once, when beginning again to speak, he
was overpowered by the loud voice of Johnson, who
was at the opposite end of the table, and did not notice
the attempt. Thus disappointed, Goldsmith
threw down his hat in a passion, and said—‘take it’—looking
angrily at Johnson. Then Toplady was
about to speak, Oliver hearing Johnson growl something,
and thinking he was about to go on again,
begged he would let Toplady proceed, as the latter
had heard Johnson patiently for an hour. ‘Sir,’
roared Johnson, ‘I was not going to interrupt the
gentleman. Sir, you are impertinent!’ Goldy said
nothing, but continued in the company for some
time. When they all met in the evening at the club,
Johnson said aside to Boswell, ‘I’ll make Goldsmith
forgive me:’ and then aloud—‘Doctor Goldsmith,
something passed between us, where you and I
dined: I ask your pardon.’ Goldsmith answered
placidly, ‘It must be much from you, sir, that I take
ill.’ After which,” says Boswell, “Goldsmith was
himself again, and rattled away as usual.” All this
exhibits the usual animus of Boswell, the coarse tyranny
of Johnson, and the fine disposition of Oliver,
in a fair light. Goldsmith knew Johnson intimately—<span class='it'>intus
et in cute</span>—and used to say of him, with
that happiness of thought and fancy which his bashfulness
could, not entirely mar—“there is no arguing
with Johnson; when his pistol misses fire, he knocks
you down with the but-end of it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Johnson talked for victory—Goldsmith for enjoyment.
The former came armed at all points into
the argument—the latter was but too glad to fling off
all lettered restraint, remove his harness as it were,
and enjoy himself in the midst of what he loved so
cordially, the sight of happy human faces. Johnson
generally entered into conversation like an athlete or
a bull into an arena. He once said to Boswell, after
some literary reunion—“we had good talk to-night.”
“Yes, sir,” returned the admiring disciple, “you
tossed and gored several persons.” A pleasant affair,
truly, one of those conversations on philosophy
and polite literature must have been in the Johnsonian
times. Poor Goldsmith was disposed to be
light, discursive, and unaffected in genial society—or
if affected at all, it was in the desire to contrast
his own open pleasantry with the dread gravity of
Johnson, and those who stood in awe of him. Oliver
was out of his element, in fact, among the generality
of those with whom he came into contact at
the club and elsewhere. He should have lived in
the days of the loud-laughing Jerrold, and Hunt, the
old boy at all times, and the pun-elaborating Lamb;
he should have known Moore, the gayest of wits,
and Maginn, who also <span class='it'>stammered</span> forth “his logic
and his wisdom and his wit.” The simplicity of his
disposition, and the Irish impulses of his nature, led
him to desire a hearty enjoyment of his social hours
in the midst of his friends. He would have quips
and cranks, and a spice of that happy frivolity which
comes as easy to the finest geniuses as their more dignified
inspirations. But such he was not to have at the
Literary Club, where Jupiter-Johnson took the chair—or
rather the field, and “glowering frae him,” kept
himself perfectly ready to “toss and gore,” as usual.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A great deal of pedantry and paradox was mixed
up with the literature of Goldsmith’s time; men’s
minds were apt to be as stiff as their costumes, and
<a id='auth'></a>authors were considered to have a certain professional
dignity to support.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Oliver, as we have said, was out of his element
in the midst of such circumstances; he did not admire
the gravity which is too often a mysterious
carriage of the body to cover the defects of the mind,
but was disposed in company</p>

<p class='noindent'>In mixed society he seemed very unequal. He very
often sat silent, and the shyness of his disposition
was thought to be an affectation of dignity. But
when the occasion grew more festive, as at after-dinner
times, and the poet’s temperament had received
the stimulus of aliment and wine, he would
overflow with pleasant paradoxes, jests and all sorts
of unguarded hilarity, believing that those about
him who were aware of the intrinsic wit and worth
of his intellect, would justify him against any thought
of ridicule or disparagement. In such moods, and
before the most fastidious wits of the day, he would
come out intrepidly with—“When I used to lodge
among the beggars in Axe Lane.” The effect of
this on his hearers (we believe it was spoken at one
of Sir Joshua Reynold’s dinners) was something
like that produced on the discomposed sovereigns
sitting round the table at Tilsit, or Erfurth—we forget
which—by Napoleon’s reminiscence, beginning—“When
I was a lieutenant in the regiment of La
Fere!” These sayings seem to show a kindred
consciousness of something beyond the conventions
of rank and name. Goldsmith was not to be laughed
at for that sally—which Socrates or Zeno would
have enjoyed very much. But the cankered and
fastidious Walpole, who was present on some such
occasion, and found the Irishman very blunt in his
mode of argument, and very unconcerned at the
rank or pretensions of Walpole himself, could not
tolerate such franknesses, and with his usual affectation
of point, called Oliver “an inspired idiot;” just
as Chesterfield had called Johnson “a respectable
Hottentot”—but indeed with greater justice; for the
moralist’s manners at table, particularly his modes
of eating, were rather savage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Goldsmith was certainly apt to blunder. But it
was when in the simple frankness of his nature he
thought he was among friends and good fellows in
such moods and moments. He put his trust in those
whose conventionalities he would offend, and who
must have felt the inferiority of their own powers
when in contact with his. Disraeli, the elder, has
made some just remarks on the wrong to which
such men expose themselves very often in society.
He says: “One peculiar trait in the conversation of
men of genius which has often injured them when
listeners are not acquainted with the men—are certain
sports of a vacant mind; a sudden impulse to
throw out opinions and take views of things in some
humor of the moment. Extravagant paradoxes and
false opinions are caught up by the humblest prosers:
and the Philistines are thus enabled to triumph over
the strong and gifted man, because in an hour of
confidence and the abandonment of his mind, he laid
his head in their lap and taught them how he might
be shorn of his strength.” All this is extremely applicable
to the case of Oliver Goldsmith.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Almost all the stories told of him to show his absurdity
or jealousy are palpably false and must be
looked on as failures. Northcote very gravely set
down how the doctor was offended, when on his
route to Paris, accompanied by Mrs. Horneck and
her daughters, to find the young ladies receive more
notice and admiration than he himself at a French
hotel. This was a stupid misconception, to say the
least of it—as Miss Horneck afterward stated, wondering
at the same time how such could ever have
arisen from the fact. Goldsmith, who was always
ready to laugh at himself, for the pleasantry of the
thing, in any of his playful moods, seeing his companions
pleased by the admiration they excited, and
wishing to amuse them, said, with an affectation of
wounded self-love, that doubtless produced the effect
he intended—“Very well, ladies; you may find
somebody else in vogue, very shortly, as well as
yourselves.” Such sallies furnish a key to most of
those things cited to the ridicule of Goldsmith.
Another story is told by Col. O’Moore. Burke and
O’Moore going to the club to dine, saw Oliver
among others looking at some foreign women in a
balcony in Leicester Square. Arrived at the club,
Burke affected to be offended with Goldsmith and
being questioned, said he could hardly think of being
friendly with a man who could say what the doctor
had just uttered in the public street. Goldsmith
eagerly asking to know what it was, was told he
expressed surprise that the crowd should look at
these women, while he, a man of genius, was passing
by!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Surely, I did not say so,” says Oliver.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How should I know it then?” replies Burke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“True,” admits Goldsmith, “I thought, indeed,
something of the kind; but I did not think I uttered
it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>All this is merely clumsy and incredible—just the
sort of anecdote for the colonel to tell. Just as preposterous
was the story of Goldsmith asking Gibbon,
who came into his room while he was writing the
History of Greece, “What king was that who gave
Alexander so much trouble in India?” and on being
informed it was Montezuma, writing it down at
once! Then, there is Beauclerc’s funny thing—how
Goldsmith, being once conversing with Lord
Shelburne (termed “Malagrida” by some political
opponent,) told his lordship he wondered they called
him Malagrida, <span class='it'>for</span> Malagrida was an honest man!
Such were the false and stupid reminiscences that
went to compose the memory of poor Goldsmith—a
man of the finest perceptions and most excellent
judgment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Exaggerated stories are also told of his love of dress
and his personal vanity in other matters. His peach-colored
coat is thought to be a good jest. It is indeed
true, that he was somewhat expensive in dress;
but a man who frequented the politest society of the
time was obliged to pay attention to his wardrobe.
And if his taste in the matter of coats and cocked-hats
was not so true as it ever was in literary matters,
it may be stated that Aristotle also underwent
the rebuke of Plato for his foppishness. A great deal
is made of the fact that Goldsmith once attempted to
leap from the bank to a little island in a pond, at
Versailles, and fell into the water. This is all natural
enough, if we refer it to his usual playfulness
and the remembrance of the active habits of his
youth. It amounts to no more than the gravest man
may have to answer for, if all his doings were
chronicled. Johnson, when quite an old man, used
to make such heavy attempts to be lively. Mrs.
Thrale (we believe) says that one day, approaching
her house, the philosopher flung himself in sport over
a gate that lay in his way, and was very much elated
by his own agility.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With all his dignity and philosophy Johnson felt a
little jealous of Goldsmith, at times, and used to express
disparaging opinions of him. He said—“His
genius is great, but his knowledge is small. As they
say of a generous man—it is a pity he is not rich;
so we may say of Goldsmith—it is a pity he is not
knowing.” He also said no one was more foolish
than Goldsmith when he had not a pen in his hand,
or wiser when he had, thus parodying the saying
applied to Charles the Second—</p>

<p class='line0'>&ensp;And never did a wise one.”</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

</div>

<p class='noindent'>In expressing these opinions, Dr. Johnson seems to
forget what he himself has elsewhere said, very
justly—to the effect that a great deal of the truth and
correctness of a sentiment is sacrificed to the point
of it. He also says, amusingly enough—“Goldsmith
should not be always attempting to shine in
conversation,” (certainly not—this would be a sort
of contumacy in Johnson’s presence!) “he has not
temper for it.” (Johnson’s own was of such a
meek, philosophic stamp!) Even when the dignity
of Goldsmith’s doings was more questionable than
that of his sayings or writings, the doctor could not
help entertaining some little pique. When Oliver
had chastised Evans, the publisher, for printing some
offensive observations, Johnson remarked to his <span class='it'>fidus
Achates</span>: “Why, sir, this is the first time he <span class='it'>has</span>
beaten; he may have <span class='it'>been</span> beaten before. This is a
new pleasure to him.” He alluded to a white-bait
dinner at Blackwall, where Goldsmith, denouncing
obscene novels and the indelicacies of Tristram
Shandy, created a warm argument among the feasters,
whence they fell into personalities; then into
an uproar, and thence to fisticuffs, in the midst of
which, it is said, Oliver got a smart share of what
was going—before they broke up this feast of reason—pretty
fairly expressed by the <span class='it'>Irish</span> participles,
<span class='it'>bait</span>, beating, beaten! The affair was very laughable,
to be sure. But Johnson should have remembered
that he himself had knocked his own publisher
down—Osborne. He should have commented more
leniently on poor Goldie. The old feuds between
authors and publishers were as lively in those times
as they were before or have been since. Goldsmith
wrote a very dignified public letter, to justify the
beating, and showed that there were certain rascalities
which called for the imposition of violent hands
upon them, and that the punishment of them was
sanctioned by the sense of society, though against
the letter of the law. But, as we were saying,
Johnson permitted himself on many occasions to
disparage Goldsmith. Still, in the main, he has
stood up strongly for the fame of his friend—thereby
showing that such opinions as the foregoing were
not very just or generous. When his conscience
got the better of his occasional feelings, as was
usually the case—for his nature was intrinsically
good (he “had nothing of the bear but the skin,” as
Goldsmith used to say,) he would do Oliver justice.
In this, to be sure, he had a consoling sense of the
superiority and patronage which belong to such a
championship; and, in maintaining the cause of his
friend, he could argue vigorously for himself—for,
their fortunes were very much alike. He could
express his own feelings of scorn for the conventions
or misconceptions of society, in defending the character
of a man of genius. Be this as it may, he has
left on record sentiments highly honorable to himself
as well as to Goldsmith; and has had some of
them graven in his epitaph on the poet, dramatist
and historian</p>

<p class='pindent'>Goldsmith, in society, was not the oddity he is
represented to be by Boswell, Walpole and the
others. There is no such contradictory monster as
they would have us think him. The man who was
“inspired” with such true genius—who drew the
Vicar of Wakefield—could not have been the
“idiot” that the artificial Walpole would depict
him. Nor could any man who “wrote like an
angel” ever come to “talk like poor Poll,” as Garrick
says with such antithetical fallacy. The fact
was, Oliver’s broad Westmeath accent, his stammering
mode of speaking, and the careless impulses
of his thoroughly Irish temperament gave his manners
a strange, it may be said an intolerable originality,
in an age of forms and observances in literature
and life. It was only in a stiff, artificial age,
like that in which his lot was cast, that Goldsmith
would have been so rudely treated and ridiculed. It
is felt that it was not Julian but the polished Antiochans
which were ridiculous. We also know that
though they laughed at Socrates he was not <span class='it'>laughed
at</span>, as he himself expresses it. Absurdity was the
cant word of Goldsmith’s day for the good-nature,
generosity, originality and independence which he
brought with him, along with that <span class='it'>Shibboleth</span> of his
from the simple and honorable home of his childhood,
and which he never lost in all the mazes and
trials of the great metropolis.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His absurdities, as they termed them, did not, after
all, prevent Goldsmith from being well received in
the best society of London—a very strong proof, in
itself, that the doctor was as much a gentleman in
demeanor as he was by his birth and education, and
could mingle with the polite and the fashionable on
very easy terms and without any violence to his
habits. His sayings in company—such as have been
remembered—are full of point and pleasantry, and
show that he could command, even with his shy
utterance, much of the happy spirit of his written
style. He was once explaining to a friend, in Johnson’s
presence, that in fables where inferior creatures
are interlocutors, these should be made to speak in
character—that animals on land, for instance, should
converse differently from little fishes. This idea,
which is, after all, only that which Shakspeare has
so beautifully realized, with a difference, in his
elves of a Midsummer Night’s Dream, his Caliban
and his Ariel, set Johnson a-chuckling at its childishness,
which Goldsmith perceiving, he retorted
very happily—laughing, too—“You may laugh,
doctor, but if <span class='it'>you</span> had to make little fishes speak,
they would talk like whales!” A palpable hit at
the sesquipedalian moralist.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If we come to consider Goldsmith’s influence upon
the literary character of his age, we will probably
agree that it was second to that of no other author.
Indeed, it must be considered superior to that of him
who was supposed to sway most authoritatively the
world of letters. Doctor Johnson’s style, to be sure,
was very impressive, and created a host of imitators—the
most remarkable of whom was Gibbon, who
surpassed his model in a certain measured splendor
of rhetoric—which is, nevertheless, very wearisome
at times. But Goldsmith’s many modes of a very
simple and lucid style produced then, and since, a
more permanent effect. He wrote the best poem,
the best comedy, the best novel, and the best history—at
least, the best written history of the day. Johnson
preferred his historic manner to that of Hume or Robertson.
Though Goldsmith’s literature had not the
marked effect of Doctor Johnson’s grand Latin idiom;
yet being more varied, it reached the wider popularity,
such as time has confirmed and increased.
Goldsmith kept to the ancient ways of the vernacular,
trod by Addison, Swift, Hume, etc.; and contributed
not a little to neutralize the Johnsonian mode—which,
after all, was recognized to be a corrupt rhetoric, and a
weakening of the genius of the Anglo-Saxon tongue.
Goldsmith’s, “racy of the soil,” was secured against
fluctuations of taste, and the charm of it is as fresh to-day
as it was eighty years ago. His comedies abolished
the mawkish sentimentality which—derived
partly from the Richardson school—dulled the spirit
of the stage, and asserted, very happily, the old comic
claim of setting audiences in a roar. The change
was heartily welcomed; the Londoners crowded to
the comedy to be merry, and a respected household
tradition, now especially recalled for the sake
of the dear old narrator of it, has more than once informed
us how George the Third, his fresh-colored
English face, full of merriment, and the plain, little
cock-nosed Charlotte by his side, in the royal box,
both joined in the hilarity of the audience during one
of the first performances of “She Stoops to Conquer,”
at Covent Garden Theatre; but, at the story of “Old
Grouse in the Gun-room,” where everybody laughed
on the stage, his majesty fairly chimed in with Mr.
Hardcastle, and laughed as loud as any one in the
house. Thus, in the words of Mr. Colman—</p>

          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>“Thus, cheered, at length, by Pleasantry’s bright ray,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;Nature and mirth resumed their legal sway,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;And Goldsmith’s genius basked in open day.”</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Goldsmith’s prose is the sweetest and most harmonious
in the language. His narrative and historical
manner is easy and expressive—more so than
Hume’s. And here, we may remark how odd it
was to see a pair of provincials—an Irishman and a
Scotchman, each with the brogue or the burr upon
his tongue, and in his manner—vindicating the native
purity of the Anglo-Saxon against the subversive genius
of two of the foremost English writers—Johnson
and Gibbon—and finally overcoming them on their
own ground. Goldsmith, in short, as Johnson said
very well, ornamented whatever he touched, and
some of the dryest disquisitions become in his hands
as interesting as a Persian tale. An honor of another
kind belongs to Goldsmith.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Among the authors of England none did more than
himself to support the dignity and independence of
British authorship, the honor of which was so sadly
smirched by the dedications of Dryden and Locke,
as well as by others before and after them. Oliver
instead of thinking of the high nobility, set a fine example
to all writers—he dedicated “She Stoops to
Conquer,” to Doctor Johnson; “The Deserted Village”
to his other friend, Reynolds; and “The Traveler”—his
first poem—to his brother, all exhibiting
the affectionate manliness of his disposition. And
with reference to his brother, we have a trait of
Goldsmith’s character which is worth the Vicar of
Wakefield. He was once invited to call on the Duke
of Northumberland, when that nobleman was going to
Ireland, as Lord Lieutenant. Sir John Hawkins,
who was leaving the duke’s presence as Oliver was
going in, tells the story with indignant reprobation
of the poet’s fatal absurdity. His grace having complimented
Goldsmith on his writings (he had just
written Edwin and Angelina to amuse the duchess),
said he was going to Ireland, and would be happy to
promote the doctor’s interests in any way, etc.
Whereupon the doctor told the duke that the publishers
were treating him pretty well just then; but
that he had a poor brother in Ireland, a curate on
forty pounds a year, with a large family, and begged
his grace to remember <span class='it'>him</span>, etc. “In this way,”
groans Sir John Hawkins, “did Goldsmith dispose
of his chance of patronage and fortune.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As a poet, Goldsmith at once took the rank which
posterity has almost unanimously confirmed. The
finest critics in the language have honored the claims
of the poet of Auburn. Lord Byron says, “where
is the poetry of which one half is good? Is it Milton’s?
Is it Dryden’s; or any one’s except Pope’s
and Goldsmith’s, of which <span class='it'>all</span> is good?” There is
no need at this time of day, to speak of the nature,
pathos and elegance of Goldsmith’s muse. In stateliness
he sometimes approaches Dryden; as in those
noble verses which Johnson could not read without
a tremor and tears of pride:—</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='line0'>“Stern o’er each bosom reason holds her state,</p>

<p class='line0'>&ensp;Pride in their port, defiance in their eye,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;I see the lords of human kind pass by.”</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

</div>

<p class='noindent'>But there is one respect in which we think his poetry
has not been appreciated as it ought.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The great change which has taken place in poetry
from the classic rhythmus and Cæsural canons of
Pope’s school, to the nature and fresher phraseology
of our modern period has been commonly dated from
the rise of Wordsworth and Coleridge—sometimes
traced to the effect of Bishop Percy’s ballads.
There is generally an incorrectness in any attempt
to fix mutations of taste and fashions of style down
to chronology. Instead of thinking the old poetic
spirit of England was revived at the close of the
eighteenth century, we believe it had not died at all;
but had lived on, in exile, while a foreign influence
bore sway—as the line of Edgar Atheling lived long
ago; destined, however, in the fullness of time to be
restored to its ancient supremacy. Bishop Percy’s
ballads were a manifestation of that spirit, not a
cause of it—though he might not have known it—a
necessary reaction of the national mind. At the time
of their appearance Goldsmith’s poetry was exhibiting
the first tokens of the coming change. The
theme of it was human nature, with its common
feelings, hopes, and sufferings; and pouring the
warmth, pathos and earnestness of his own heart into
it, he rendered it attractive and popular. His
verse had all the vernacular ease and grace of his
prose, with a polish only inferior to Pope’s. In his
original hands the heroic couplet was not “the clock-work
tintinnabulum of rhyme” beaten by the Cawthornes,
Darwins, and Hayleys of the day. In his
prose criticisms he wrote against the cumbrous use
of epithets, and discarded it in his own verse. He
amused himself occasionally among his friends, by
reciting the lines of several popular authors, with a
dissyllable omitted. He would read the opening of
Gray’s Elegy in this way:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>The curfew tolls the knell of day,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;The lowing herd winds o’er the lea:</p>
<p class='line0'>The ploughman homeward plods his way</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;And leaves the world to gloom and me.</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

</div>

<p class='noindent'>In this respect he must have been rather hard on Johnson,
whose poetry in many respects is “the hubbub
of words,” which Wordsworth so scornfully terms
some of it. The first couplet of the doctor’s great
satire has one superfluous line—</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->

<p class='line0'>Survey mankind from China to Peru—</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

</div>

<p class='noindent'>The poem would have started better from “Survey.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Johnson, indeed, used to ridicule the taste that
came up with the Percy Ballads. They had “a false
gallop of verses,” in his opinion, and he said he could
go on making such stanzas for an hour together,
thus:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->

<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;With his hat in his hand.</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

</div>

<p class='noindent'>But in this, as in a great many other matters of literature,
morals, and taste, Johnson did not prove himself
an infallible doctor. Goldsmith’s taste, of a
genuine <span class='it'>vates</span>, led him at once to appreciate the
simple lyrics of Percy’s collection; and his charming
ballad of the Hermit shows how he felt the fresh
spirit of them. This excellent poem was written for
the Countess of Northumberland. And here we
may remark that three of the most attractive modern
English poems were composed especially for ladies
of high rank—or at their suggestion:—The Lay of
the Last Minstrel, at the wish of Lady Anna Scott,
daughter of the Duke of Buccleuch; The Sofa, for
Lady Hesketh; and Goldsmith’s Ballad for the
Countess.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Goldsmith certainly took the initiative in the
change which was followed and aided by “the
manly and idiomatic simplicity of Cowper”—before
Wordsworth and Coleridge were heard of. He
effected his share of the reform quietly; he wrote no
doctrinal prefaces, but went and did what he meant.
In teaching and practicing a new mode, he did not
make the noise of a reformer. He was rather more
favorable to the style of Dryden and Pope than to
some of the ballad enthusiasts that talked and wrote
in extremes. He reformed without any affectation
of apostleship in the matter of words and syllables—was
no literary red-republican. Thirty or forty
years later Wordsworth cried, <span class='it'>Heureka</span>! as if something
were then first done or found. He announced
his theories in long didactic prefaces, laid down doctrines
which the genius of Goldsmith and Cowper
had already suggested or acted on, and fell into extravagancies
which they never dreamed of—exhibiting
his muse in a very <span class='it'>sans culotte</span> condition;
the term (having a masculine reference) is somewhat
inapplicable—or should be in a well-regulated state
of society—though Mrs. Bloomer is of a contrary
opinion. But, Wordsworth, in his love of unadorned
Nature, used, in fact, to pull off her <span class='it'>garments</span>, along
with her <span class='it'>ornaments</span>, as if he thought, with those
other honest fanatics, the early Quakers, that a state
of nudity was a state of grace! Coleridge and
Southey were his disciples, but not such mighty prosers;
and Coleridge was a far superior spirit to the
two others, in all subtle thought and lofty expression,
though some of Wordsworth’s lines are truly fine.
As for Southey, we are disposed to justify Lord
Byron in his contempt of the man and his poetry.
He was of an overweening and splenetic nature;
there was nothing in his character to neutralize the
impression made by the “Vision of Judgment” and
“Don Juan” respecting him. With regard to Oliver
Goldsmith, Southey is convicted of a willful injustice
to the memory of a more genuine poet and
better man than himself. In his Life of Cowper,
speaking of the poets that came after Pope, he never
once alludes to the author of The Deserted Village!
He says “the school of Pope was gradually losing
its influence,” in proof of which, “almost every
poem of any considerable length which obtained any
celebrity, during the half century between Pope and
Cowper, was writ in blank verse. With the single
exception of Falconer’s Shipwreck, it would be in
vain to look for any rhymed poem of that age, and
of equal extent, which is held in equal estimation
with the works of Young, Thompson, Glover,
Somerville, Dyer, Akenside and Armstrong.” We
all know that one cause, at least, of this studied
omission of Goldsmith’s name, was Byron’s favorable
opinion of his poetry. This deliberate wrong
to the memory of a great departed poet, because of
a vehement hatred of a living one, shows Southey’s
disposition to be as ungenerous, we may say as contemptible,
as his hexameters are coldly manufactured,
and surely fated to be dry upon the popular
palate to the end of time. He affects to rank Oliver
among the followers of Pope and the imitators of his
style. But there is as little resemblance between
Pope’s terse and splendid rhetoric, and the graphic
simplicity and nature of Goldsmith’s poetry, as between
the blank verse of Wordsworth or Southey
and the noble rhythmus of Paradise Lost. Goldsmith
scorned as much to fashion his verse after the
mode of Pope as he did to detract from the great
merit of that author. He cultivated the elegance and
rhyming periods of the classic school, and so identified
these with his own original spirit, that he recommended
anew what, in themselves, are genuine
graces of English poetry. They truly belong to the
genius of it—as his fine taste must have taught him—and
must continue to do so, in spite of all the sprawling
Thalaba hexameters of Southey. The heroic
rhyming couplet is capable of as much force, flexibility,
and beauty, as any other form of English
verse, and is never monotonous in original hands—whether
of Chaucer, Dryden, Crabbe, or Keats.
Southey, in thus pretending to shut his eyes to the
claims of the author of The Traveler, must have still
felt (for he was not without a critical sense of the
genuine in the Anglo-Saxon) that the great mass of
his own poetry, so like a <span class='it'>hortus siccus</span>, with its
elaborated fancies and exotic imagery, must mainly
lie upon the shelves of libraries, while Goldsmith’s
is fated to be found upon all book-stalls, and to go
about to the households and hearts of the people—to
be printed in innumerable editions, ornamented with
costly engravings, and be found in all parts of the
world where the English language is spoken—read
by yet unborn generations on the banks of the Burrampooter,
the Mississippi, or the Swan River, as
freshly and as feelingly as it was, at first, and still
continues to be, on those of the Thames and the
Tweed and the Shannon. And so it is; and thus, as
the clown in Twelfth Night says, “does the whirligig
of time bring in his revenges.” Somebody, we
forget who, says the praise of the people is a finer
thing than the homage of the critics: and, in this way,
the ghost of Oliver must be satisfied to see how posterity
vindicates him against the early and the latter
detractors. He was a true English poet with an
Irish heart; and Sir Joshua Reynolds evinced the
genuine prescience of genius (though the world said
it was only friendship or flattery) when he gave the
ugly face of Oliver that classic <span class='it'>tournure</span> which should
best suit his destined rank in the peerage of Parnassus.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Goldsmith had left his mark upon the literature
of his age, and plainly indicated the character of that
which was to come, when he quitted his painful
desk forever, in 1774, being then about forty-five
years old. At that age Cowper was still unmentioned
in the world of letters, but was preparing to
carry out the salutary innovations which the other
had begun. Goldsmith died £2000 in debt. The
booksellers had advanced him money for works to
be written. Everybody trusted him. “Was ever
poet so trusted before?” says Dr. Johnson. Burke
wept when he heard Oliver was dead. Such tears
were as eloquent as Johnson’s epitaph. The eyes of
the latter were moistened, too; and in a sonorous
Greek tetrastich, he called on those who cared for
Nature, for the charms of song, or the deeds of ancient
days, to weep for the historian, the naturalist,
and the poet. Poor Goldie died when he had a
chance of liberating himself, in another way, from
the task-work of publishers. “Every year he lived,”
says Dr. Johnson, “he would have deserved Westminster
Abbey more and more.” But Goldsmith’s
true Westminster Abbey is the <span class='it'>volitare per ora</span> and
the keeping of his honest memory by the <span class='it'>oi polloi</span>,
at their firesides, along with the <span class='it'>lares</span>—when, as
Macaulay would say, a traveler from the empire of
Van Diemans Land may probably be sketching the
ruins of that British Santa Croce from a broken arch
of London Bridge:—</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>A STRUGGLE WITH THE WORLD.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>A period of wandering and of danger, of flitting
from place to place, and land to land, of difficulties
and distresses, of almost daily peril, of constant uncertainty
as to the future, would seem to furnish
matter enough for memory; but yet the period immediately
succeeding my separation from Father
Bonneville, is very dim and obscure to remembrance.
I staid so short a time in any place, one
event trod so fast upon the heels of another, that
neither scene nor event had time to fix itself firmly
in memory, before, like the grass upon a public pathway,
it was trodden down by passing feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At this time, I could speak three languages with
almost equal facility: English, French, and German;
but English perhaps, I understood most thoroughly—at
all events, I know, I generally thought in that
language. This facility was of very great advantage
to me, and I notice it on that account, as I could
pass wherever those tongues were spoken for a native
of the country. It is true, I had not soon occasion
to see France again; but I wandered through
many parts of Switzerland, where French was in
common use.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The terrible dissensions and frightful bloodshed
that were going on in that once fair and peaceful
land, soon drove me forth, however, though I anxiously
continued my inquiries for Father Bonneville,
as long as there seemed a chance of success.
My steps were then turned toward the North of
Germany, without object; and more directed by accidental
circumstances, than by any predetermination
of my own, I walked on foot the whole way;
for the hundred louis afforded but small means, and
I had learned the necessity, and the mode of economy.
Fifty of those hundred louis I put by with the
resolution never to touch them except in the last extremity;
and no one can tell the amount of distress
and privation I submitted to, rather than violate that
resolution. Every thing I could part with, I disposed
of before I set out: my beloved rifle amongst
the rest. I had a good many little trinkets, which I
had purchased in the foolish vanity of youth, but I
got rid of them all, and only retained my watch,
with a seal bearing a coat of arms attached to it,
(which seal I had possessed as long as I could remember
any thing) and the ring and little gold chain
which had been given to me by Madame de Salins.
My clothes were all compressed into a knapsack,
and in my hunter’s garb, with thick, coarse shoes
upon my feet, I plodded on my weary way, over
mountain and moor, through field and forest, in the
town and in the country, seeking wherever opportunity
seemed to present itself, for some employment,
but finding none. All I could offer to do was to
teach, and the whole of Europe was so overloaded
with persons in the same situation, who had been
driven forth from France by the Revolution, that it
was hardly possible to find any profitable occupation
of that kind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Often, often at peasant’s hut, or farmer’s house, I
have begged a morsel of black bread, and a draught
of water. Perhaps this was not very right, when I
had actually money in my pocket, but yet it is a
common custom in that country, and almost every
artisan, before he becomes a master in his trade,
spends some years in what is called <span class='it'>fechting</span> or in
other words, begging his way from place to place.
The assistance was almost always readily given, and
sometimes the charity of woman would add a drink
of milk, or a few kreutzers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I was within sight of the town of Hamburgh before
any chance of occupation presented itself, and
then it came about in rather a singular manner. I
was walking on at a quick pace, at about three miles
from the city, on the same side of the Elbe, when I
saw from a little garden gate, close by a small summer-house,
an elderly gentleman come forth, of
somewhat peculiar appearance. He was exceedingly
thin, brisk and active-looking, with powdered
hair and a thick queue, an enormous white cravat, a
vast frill, and a bluish-gray cloak, somewhat threadbare.
There was a keen, sharp look about his eyes
and mouth, which was not very promising, and I
walked on without taking much notion of him. His
pace, however, was as fast as my own, and we kept
nearly side by side for about half-a-mile, without
speaking, till we came upon a long wooden bridge,
which every one who has been in Hamburgh must
recollect. He had eyed me, I perceived, with great
attention, and at length he burst forth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, young man,” he said, “I think you might
have given me good time of day, at least.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do not know you,” I answered, “and do not
like to take liberties with strangers.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mighty modest,” rejoined he. “What’s your
trade?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I explained to him, that I was seeking employment
as a teacher, having been driven out of my
own country by Revolution. That seemed to touch
him; for he had a great abhorrence of Revolutions,
and he asked me what I could teach.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I told him that I was competent to give instruction
in Latin, Greek, Mathematics, French, English and
German.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hundert tausand!” he exclaimed, “the lad is an
Encyclopædia. Let us see what you can do;” and
immediately he poured forth a passage of Euripides,
with which I was quite familiar. I rendered it at
once into German, and he then made me give it him
in French, which I did as well as I could, in that
meagre tongue. He rubbed his hands all the time,
saying—“Ha—ha.” He spoke to me in English,
too, such as it was, and though his pronunciation
would have made a dry salmon laugh, yet I found
that he had a very thorough acquaintance with all
the works of the best authors of England. The conversation
soon became interesting to us both, and we
went on chatting and discussing till we reached the
gates of the town. There he suddenly paused, and
looking at me from head to foot, exclaimed—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So you want employment—you are poor, I dare
say—very poor?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I replied, that it was hardly possible to be poorer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, then, you must not lodge in dear inns,” he
said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I told him I did not know where to lodge, as I was
a stranger in the town.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll tell you,” he answered, “I’ll tell you. You
must lodge in the lower town—in the Hardt-Gasse—number
five—with Widow Steinberger.” He repeated
the direction over three times, and then added—“She
should board you for two dollars a week—don’t
give her more. Everybody asks too much, in
expectation of being beaten down—a bad system, but
universal.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>All this time he had been continually turning himself
round upon his right leg, between each two or
three words, as if intending to go away, and I perceived
no inclination upon his part to help me to employment;
but when he came to the end of his directions,
he drew out a little note-book, wrote something
in it with his usual rapidity, tore out the leaf,
and gave it to me saying—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come to see me—come to see me. I’ll think of
what can be done. We’ll find you employment,
Polyglot,” and away he turned and left me. I then,
with better hope than I had hitherto had, inquired
my way to the street which he had indicated, without
having curiosity enough to look at any thing but
his name, which I found to be “Herman Haas.” I
was a long time in finding the Hardt-Gasse, and before
I did so, I plunged into many a dark and gloomy
street of tall, old houses, and warehouses. At length,
the end of a little lane was pointed out to me, the
appearance of which was more in harmony with the
state of my finances, than my desires. But I found,
on walking up it, that the houses must, at one time,
have been of some importance, judging by the size
of the doors, and the ornaments which clustered
round them. At number five, I stopped; and finding
neither knocker or bell, opened the door and
went in.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who’s there?” screamed a voice from the right,
and entering a large, dim, old-fashioned room, I
found myself in the presence of a stately dame, engaged
in the dignified occupation of cooking, who
instantly demanded what I wanted. I found that
this was no other than Madame Steinberger, herself,
but before she would enter into any negociations in
regard to boarding and lodging me, she insisted upon
knowing who had sent me there. When I showed
her the paper, however, she exclaimed—“Professor
Haas! Oh! that is another matter;” and our arrangements
were soon effected. As the professor had
anticipated, she asked more at first than she was inclined
to take, but his dictum was all powerful with
her, and I was soon installed in a comfortable little
room, with the advantage of a large sitting-room besides,
when I chose to use it, for which accommodation,
with three meals in the day, I was to pay
two dollars a week.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the following morning, at the hour which my
landlady told me would be most convenient, I went
to call upon the professor, whom I found in his study;
though how he contrived to study at all, I cannot
make out; for he was in a state of continual movement—the
most excitable German I ever saw.
During the greater part of the time he was talking
to me, he was taking down one book and putting up
another, turning over papers upon the table, dipping
a pen in the ink and wiping it again, with other
operations to carry off his superfluous activity. He
must have been quiet at some time; for he certainly
was a very learned man; but I never could discover
when it was. At length, after having asked a great
number of questions, he said—“I have got one pupil
for you, to make a beginning—Come, I’ll show her
to you;” and leading me into another room, on the
same floor, he presented me to a young lady, who
sat there embroidering, as his daughter. “There,”
he said, “teach her English, and any thing else you
can. I have no time—she is a good girl, but
slow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The young lady looked up in his face with a calm,
placid smile, saying, “If there were two such quick
people as you in the house, my father, they would
always be running against each other.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“True,” replied the old man, “true, and philosophical.
Nature loves contrasts as well as harmonies.
Opposing forces counteract each other. You,
my Louise, are my <span class='it'>vis inertiæ</span>. Without you I
should get on too fast. But come, young gentleman—what
is your name?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Louis de Lacy,” I replied.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I like that, I like that,” answered the old man
“The <span class='it'>De</span>, speaks blood and good political principles—but
come—we will settle the terms in my own
room, and will try to get you something more to do
by and bye.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I found the good professor had as accurate a knowledge
of making a bargain, as he had of Greek or
Latin. He calculated the worth of my services to a
pfennig, and, as I found afterward, if I had made
the slightest opposition, would have beaten me down
still lower; for he had a pleasure in such sort of
triumphs. I let him arrange it all his own way,
however, and left to his own generosity, he probably
added a little to the sum which he had intended to
give. It was agreed that I was to teach his daughter
two hours during the day, and as soon as all this
was settled, he pushed me by the shoulders toward
the door, saying, “There, go, begin at once. You
have three hours before dinner. I must go to my
recitations.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I found the way back to the room where Louise
Haas was seated, and where I passed two hours of
every day, for nearly nine months, and generally the
greater part of every Sunday. She was a pretty
creature, with small, well-shaped features, a very
graceful form, though plump and rounded, and a
bright, clear complexion, which varied a good deal
under different emotions. Her mother had died, I
found, some four or five years before, of that pest of
northern countries, consumption. There was nobody
in the house but herself, her father, and two
women servants: hardly any society was admitted
within the doors, but grave old professors, with long
hair, not very well combed; and thus tutor and pupil,
like Abelard and Heloise, were left alone together
for many an hour—I having her father’s
commands to teach her English, and any thing else
I could. Father Bonneville’s good lessons, however,
some knowledge of the world, and many hard experiences,
together with other feelings, which I
cannot well describe, prevented me from even thinking
of taking any unfair advantage of my situation.
It was natural, however, that in such circumstances,
young acquaintance should speedily ripen into intimacy,
and intimacy into friendship. Nay, it was not
unnatural that little marks of kindness and tenderness
should pass between us; for though very calm
and gentle, she was of a loving and caressing disposition.
I found her far from dull—a very apt scholar;
but sometimes there were things she could not comprehend,
and then she would look smiling in my
face, and ask if she was not very stupid, and let her
hand drop into mine and rest there, as a messenger
sent to beseech forbearance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We were both very young; she not more than
eighteen, and I about twenty, and strange new feelings
began to come over my heart toward her. I
will not even now say that it was love; and then, I
would not inquire what it was, at all. It was a tenderness—a
feeling of gentle, quiet affection—a fondness
for her society—a pleasure in seeing those soft
eyes, look into mine, and a gratitude for the kindness
she ever showed, and took every opportunity
of showing. What she felt, I learned afterward;
but let me turn once more to the course of my life
in Hamburgh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>By the kind offices of the good old professor, I obtained
several other pupils, and I had the great happiness
of finding my income exceed my expenditure.
I threw off my traveling garb; I brought out from
my knapsack the clothing which I had so carefully
saved: I gained admittance into some of the society
of the town, and though I do not think I was ever
very vain, whatever vanity I had, received some
encouragement. But my favorite resort was still
the professor’s house. He and his daughter were
my first friends in the city, and I became more and
more intimate with him every day. He was pleased
with the progress his daughter made, and he was
also pleased with the little assistance which I gave
him, from time to time, in different works he was
compiling. While I wrote for him, or looked out
passages for him, he could fidget about the room at
his case, and get into every corner of it in five
minutes. At the end of a month, I had a general
invitation to spend my evenings there whenever I
pleased—and I did please very often. Then, after a
while, I was sent with Louise to church; for she
went regularly, although I can’t say that the professor
ever wore out the steps of any religious edifice,
and I took care not to allow my Roman Catholic
education to prevent my joining a Protestant
congregation, with my pretty little pupil. Indeed I
was hanging at this time very slightly by the skirts
of the garments of Rome. I had been reading the
Bible a great deal lately. I read some Romanist
books also, but I found that the two did not agree,
and I liked the Bible best. Besides all this, as
spring succeeded to winter, and days lengthened,
and suns grew warm, there was every now and then
a moment of very sweet, spring-like happiness,
when after attending the church, Louise and I took
a farther walk, till the hour of the good professor’s
dinner. Sometimes we had another walk, too, in
the evening, and sometimes he accompanied us to
his little garden with the summer-house, near the
gate of which I had first met him. It was all very
delightful; and my ambition, which had once been
strong and wide, had by this time shrunk to very
small proportions. I could have been contented to
linger on there, with every thing just as it was, for
an indefinite period of time. But it must be remembered,
that not one word, regarding love, ever passed
between Louise and myself, except when it occurred
in passages of books. I am afraid, however, that
those passages, about this time, occurred very often.
Louise was fond of them, and I turned them up
easily for her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus it went on—for I must not dwell upon details—for
about eight months, when it so miserably
happened that an aunt of the professor’s, somewhat
younger than himself in years, but screwed up by
ancient maidenhood to the sharpest and very highest
tone of the human instrument, arrived. She was all
eyes, ears and understanding. God knows, she might
have heard every word that passed between Louise
and myself, and seen all that we did too—if looks were
excepted. But it so happened that at this time the
influence which France exerted over Prussia was so
great, that the Protectorate of the latter power over
the northern circles became a mere tyranny exercised
for the purposes of the French Republic, principally
for the persecution of emigrants. The position
of such persons as myself became very dangerous;
and the necessity of my removal from
Hamburgh was more than once talked of at the
professor’s table, where I now dined frequently. It
was even suggested that I should engage a passage
in a vessel which was about to sail in a couple of
months for the United States of America.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I could not help remarking that Louise turned
very pale when these things formed the subject of
conversation, and during six weeks of fluctuating
anxiety, I saw with sincere apprehension that she
lost health and spirits. I dared not, I could not venture
to take the idea to my heart that that dear,
amiable little creature suffered on my account; but
still I did my best to cheer and comfort her, and perhaps
became a little more tender in manner and fond
in words, than I had ever dared to be before. It
was now always, “dear Louis” and “dear Louise;”
but I do not think we went any further than that.
Often, often would she ask me questions regarding
my past history, and as much was told her as I knew
myself. She seemed to take a deep interest in it;
but as it was a subject of deep interest to me, that
I looked upon as natural. However, things had gone
on in this way for some time, my pretty Louise still
failing in health, not losing, but rather increasing her
beauty by the daily walks which she now forced
herself to take.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One day, at length, the explosion came. I met the
old professor at the top of the stairs, and instead of
turning me over at once to Louise, he beckoned me
into his own study, and then in a very excited state
flew from corner to corner of the room, glancing at
me angrily, but saying nothing. This conduct,
became so painful, that I at length broke silence,
saying, “You wish to speak with me, Herr
Haas.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ay, sir, ay!” he replied with vivacious sharpness,
“Have I not cause to speak?—have I not
cause to feel anger? Here, I took you in as a beggar,
and trusted you as a friend, and you have betrayed
my trust by winning my daughter’s affections
under the pretence of giving her instructions. Answer
it how you may, sir, it is a bad case.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As to winning your daughter’s affections, my
dear sir,” I replied, “I think you must be mistaken;
for I can boldly appeal to her to say, whether I have
once spoken on the subject of love toward her, or on
any other to justify the imputation you cast upon
me. I have always respected your hospitality, and
owing you so much as I do, I should have conceived
myself base indeed to seek her affection without
your consent. We have been thrown much together
and—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But nothing would satisfy the old man. He interrupted
me hastily, catching at my words, and saying,
“that the only way of proving my sincerity was
to quit Hamburgh at once; that his aunt, who inhabited
a country-mansion, not many miles distant,
had pointed out to him—in the course of a morning
lecture which she gave him, before her departure
that day—all that was going on between Louise and
myself; that a ship would soon sail for America, and
that if I really entertained the honorable sentiments
I expressed, I would take my passage in her, and
leave his household to recover its peace.” He
asked me, in a taunting tone, if I knew that his
daughter was his heiress, and ended by forbidding
me the house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I retired gloomy and desponding, and although he
had said nothing to lead me to such a conclusion, I felt
almost certain that he had spoken to Louise, before
his conversation with myself. There was a sort of
gloomy consolation in this conviction, and I hesitated
as to whether I should quit Hamburgh, or remain
in the hope of some change of feeling upon his
part. There is such a thing as half-love, and I
knew—I felt—that I could make the dear girl happy,
and could be very happy with her myself. The remembrance,
however, that I had nothing on earth—that
I was an outcast—a beggar, in reality, and that
she was probably rich, decided me. I went down
to the wharf. I took my passage. I paid a part of
my passage-money, but I learned—with a strange
mixture of feelings—that the sailing of the packet
was put off for a whole month, which made nearly
seven weeks from that day. The master took pains
to inform me, that this delay was occasioned by apprehension
on the part of his owners, of the English
cruisers, which, at that time, were behaving as ill
to neutral vessels, as they were behaving well in
combats with the enemy. I cared little for the reasons,
however, but went away, not knowing whether
to be pleased or sorry for this respite.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I could not quit Hamburgh without feelings of
regret—I could not leave Louise without a bitter
pang—I had done what was right—my conscience
approved; and if accident kept me in the town, and
fortune favored me with any change of circumstances,
Hope might plume her wings without any
self-reproach.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I little knew with how much anguish that period
of delay was to be filled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Good Madame Steinberger had evidently heard
something of what had occurred at the professor’s
house. She had been very kind to me, and was
kind still; but her reverence for Professor Haas
somewhat jostled with her regard for her young
lodger. I would sit for hours in the evening, dreaming
of the past, thinking of Louise, dwelling upon
happy hours that were never to return. And then
Madame Steinberger would come and attempt to
comfort me, saying, that it was mere boy and girl’s
love, and would soon pass away: that I and the
young lady would both soon forget, and that she
doubted not to see us both happy parents.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If she had taken up a red-hot skewer, and thrust
it into my heart, she would not have produced
more wretchedness than she did by her mode of
consolation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>No consolation—no thought—no philosophy was
of any avail. It was a period of intense bitterness,
filled with many varied emotions, but all of them
most painful. Had my love been more ardent,
more vehement than it was, my condition would
probably have been less sad. I should have striven—I
should have resisted—but a dark and gloomy
feeling took possession of my mind, that all who
loved me, all who felt an interest in me were destined
to be lost to me, almost as soon as I felt the
blessing of their sympathy and kindness. I was
more miserable than I can describe: there was nothing
to stimulate: to spur on endeavor: to rouse up
dormant energy. It was all dull, blank, monotonous,
melancholy inactivity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Three weeks had passed in this manner, when
one evening, as I was sitting in the larger room,
where good Frau Steinberger had kindled a fire,
with my feet upon the andirons, my head leaning on
my hand, and a book which I had vainly endeavored
to read, fallen on the floor by my side, there was a
step in the passage and the door opened. I took no
notice: I cared for nothing: I was without hope
or expectation: I was once more cast upon the
world—the fragment of a wreck upon the wide
ocean.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Suddenly a voice sounded near me, which I knew
right well. “Louis,” it said. “Louis, can you
forgive me? Louis, will you save me—will you
save my child?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I started up, and gazed upon the figure before
me. I could hardly believe it was my old friend
the professor, so pale, so worn, so sorrow-stricken
was his look.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I instantly clasped his extended hand in mine.
“My dear, good friend,” I said, “what have I to
forgive? I never sought to bring sorrow or discomfort
to your door—I would rather have died. That
is all I have to say. Tell me what I have to do—tell
me what you would wish, and I am ready to
do it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come to Louise,” he said, wringing my hand
hard. “Come to Louise—I have been a fool—a
madman—a mercenary wretch. You only can save
her—Come to her—come to her at once!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I trembled violently, but I snatched up my hat,
exclaiming, “let us go,” and rushed out of the house
before him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We flew along the streets, running against every
body—seeing nobody—heeding nobody. I asked no
questions. I knew there was something terrible;
but I was going to Louise, and felt that I should
soon know all. All houses stood upon the latch in
Hamburgh in those days. I opened the door—I
went in—I rushed up the stairs—I heard him cry
“stop, stop”—but the trumpet of an angel would
not have called me back. I entered her sitting-room.
She was not there. I heeded not. I knew
her bed-room lay beyond. I passed on and opened
the door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was seated in a chair, with all the bright color
gone from her cheek, except at one point. A physician
stood beside her, with a glass in his hand.
One old maid-servant was kneeling at her feet, wrapping
them in flannel. A handkerchief, dyed with
blood, was at her lips. Could I pause? No, had
it killed both her and myself. In an instant I was
across the room, at her feet, and my arms around
her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Louise, my own Louise,” I cried.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She looked at me with surprise—then gazed beyond
me to her father, who followed close—then
cast her arms round my neck, and leaned her head
upon my shoulder, saying in a faint voice, “Louis,
dear Louis, you have saved me—I feel—I am sure,
I shall live to be your wife.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hush, hush,” said the physician. “You must
not speak at all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You shall be his wife; you shall be his wife!”
cried her father eagerly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am very happy,” said Louise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I must have perfect silence,” said the physician,
“all will go well now; but every one must
quit the room.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No one shall tend her but myself,” I said; “but
I will be as still as night. She is mine—mine by the
deepest and the holiest ties, and I will not leave her
till this is staid.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nor did I; but through the live-long night, with
the physician and the fond old servant, I remained
silently watching, aiding, comforting, supporting her.
From time to time the spitting of blood returned;
but, at length, ice was thought of and procured.
That checked it effectually. Two hours passed
without the slightest return of that direful symptom,
and lifting her in my arms, as a father might a child,
I placed her in her bed. Then seating myself on a
little footstool at the side, I laid my head upon the
same pillow. I thought she would sleep more happily
so. Her heavy eyes closed quietly; her breathing
became calm and gentle; she slept; and ere
many minutes had passed, I slept beside her.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;'>——</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>THE FADING OF THE FLOWER.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>The hemorrhage returned no more. Louise and I
awoke at nearly the same moment, just as the morning
light was streaming in through the windows, and
she smiled sweetly to see me there, with my head
upon her pillow, and the good old servant sitting fast
asleep at the foot of her bed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Poor girl, she fancied that all danger was passed;
that she would soon be well, and that we should be
very, very happy. But, alas! grief and disappointment
too frequently shoot with poisoned arrows, and
the venom remains in the wound, after the shaft has
been extracted. She was not suffered to rise that
day, and was forbidden to speak more than a monosyllable
at a time. The good physician quoted the
Bible to her, saying—“Let your communication be
yea, yea, nay, nay, for of more cometh evil.” On
the following day, however, she rose, and gradually
was permitted to talk more and more, without any
evil effect being produced. Then for a short time
we were very happy. The good, old professor did
all that he could to make up for his previous harshness,
consented to any thing that we wished. Spontaneously
promised two thousand dollars to set
Louise and myself off in life, although we were to
make our abode with him, and talked of obtaining a
professorship for me in the university. Luckily his
avocations kept him from home a good deal each
day, otherwise his daughter’s health would have
suffered more, from his continually running in and
out of the room. She made some progress during
the first week after I returned, regained strength in
a certain degree, and I was full of hope for her, although
she had an unpleasant cough, very frequent,
though not violent. We talked of the coming days,
and of our marriage, as soon as she was quite well,
and I measured her finger for the ring, and kissed the
little hand on which it was to be placed. Oh, they
were very, very pleasant dreams, those; and I felt
that I could be exceedingly happy with that dear,
gentle girl—nay, I fancied that our happiness was
quite assured; for when I looked into her eyes, they
were so full of light and life, that one could hardly
fancy they would ever be extinguished in death and
darkness. Her bright color did not come back into
the cheek indeed, except at night, and then it was
not so generally diffused. Nevertheless, she felt
herself so well—we all thought she was so well—that
our wedding-day was fixed for about three
weeks afterward. As the time approached, however,
she was not quite so well again. The
weather changed, and two or three days of cold,
damp wind succeeded, which seemed to affect her
very much. It was judged expedient that our marriage
should be delayed for a fortnight; for she felt
the least breath of air. Nevertheless, we kept up
our spirits well for a little while, and she talked confidently
of regaining health, and being just as well as
ever. But as the days went on, I perceived with
anxiety and alarm, that she grew weaker. I used to
take her out whenever the air was soft, and the sun
shone warmly, for a little walk, in the hope that it
would restore her strength, and I soon found that she
could not go so far, without fatigue, as at first; that
to climb even the little slopes which exist in Hamburgh,
rendered her breathing short, and increased
her cough. Our walks became less and less, till,
at length, she went out no more. A change, hardly
perceptible in its progress, was gradually wrought
in her. I saw little difference between one day and
that which preceded; but when I looked back to a
week or a fortnight before, and compared the present
with the past, I could not close my eyes to the conviction
that she was worse—much worse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After a while, she took her breakfast in bed; but
made an effort to rise as early as she could, in order
to come and join me in the sitting-room. She ever
spoke cheerfully, too, and seemed to have no thought
of danger. But her father was in a terrible state; for
he couldn’t close his eyes to her situation, and I do
believe, that if the sacrifice of his life by the most
painful kind of death would have purchased his
child’s recovery, he would have made it without a
hesitation. I deceived myself more than he did. I
had heard of the effect of change of air, and I had
talked to Louise so often about her recovering
strength, and going with me for a short time, to
some milder climate, that I had almost persuaded
myself, against conviction, that it would be so. I
fancied, too, that I could make her so happy, she
must needs recover; for I knew what a blessed
balm happiness is, and thought it must be all-effectual.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As she could no longer go to church, the good
minister of the parish came several times to see her,
and as he had a friendship for me, he would often
talk with me afterward—not that I liked his conversation
now as much as formerly; for it was very
gloomy, and he strove evidently to fill my mind with
the dark anticipations which occupied his own. The
rays of religious hope, he endeavored to pour in too;
but it was earthly hopes I then clung to, and I did not
like to have them taken away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One morning, after he had been with Louise, I
found some tears upon her cheek, when I went in to
see her; for by this time she did not rise till very
late in the day, and all painful restraint being removed,
I used to go and sit by her bedside, and read
to her for some hours each morning. I was half angry
with the old man for depressing her spirits; but
she soon recovered her cheerfulness, and it was not
till two days afterward, that I learned he had told her
she must die.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I was sitting beside her, with my arm fondly cast
round her, as she sat propped up by pillows, and I
was indulging in those dreamy hopes of the future,
which I still entertained, and thought she entertained
likewise. I talked of our proposed journey to the
South, and of escaping the cold, winter weather of
Hamburgh, and of myself and her father—for he
was to go with us in this dream—nursing her like a
tender plant, till the bright summer came back again
to restore her to perfect health.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She turned her sweet eyes upon me, with a gentle
but melancholy smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you know, dear Louis,” she said, “I begin
to think that time will never be?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I looked aghast, and laying her hand tenderly in
mine, she added—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nay, more, love, I fear I shall never be your
wife, unless—unless you can make up your mind to
take me as I am now, and part with me very
soon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“O, Louise, Louise!” I cried, pressing her to my
heart, with the dreadful conviction first fully forced
upon me, by words such as she had never used before.
“Do not, do not entertain such sad fears. Be
mine at once, dear girl, and let me take you away
from this bleak place—by slow, easy journeys—by
sea—any how.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A single large tear rose in her eyes, and leaning
her head upon my shoulder, she said in a low, hesitating
voice—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will own, it would be very sweet to be your
wife, were it but for a day—yet what right have I,”
she added, “to ask you to make me so, in such a
state as this—to leave you so soon, so young a widower?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let not such thoughts stop you for a moment,
Louise,” I answered. “It will be a blessing and a
comfort to me. I can then be with you always—never
leave you—nurse you by night and day, and if
the fondest cure can save you, still keep my little
jewel for my life’s happiness.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She pressed her lips fondly upon my cheek, and
asked—“Do you really feel so, Louis?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“From my heart,” I answered. “There is no
blessing—no comfort I desire so much. Let it be
this very day—may I speak to your father?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you will,” she answered with a bright smile,
and I know not that I ever in life felt such satisfaction
as in seeing the happiness and relief I had bestowed
upon that dear girl.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The old professor was ready to grant every thing
we could desire. He was now the complete slave
of her will; but the marriage could not take place
that day, for some few formalities had to be gone
through and arrangements to be made. It was appointed
for the next evening, however, and when
Louise awoke upon her wedding-day, she sent the
maid to tell me that she felt much better.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She knew what happiness that news would give
me, and I was soon by her side to confirm the assurance
with my own eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was better. She looked better. She had
rested well, and she was able to rise an hour earlier
than she had done before. The incorrigible liar,
Hope, whispered her false promises in the ears of
both, I believe, and the hours passed more brightly
during that afternoon, than they had done for many
a day before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At eight o’clock the Protestant minister came, and
with him a notary. The physician was the only
other person present, except Louise, her father, and
myself. The irrevocable words were soon spoken,
the contract signed, and the ring upon her finger;
but as I put it on, a cold, sad feeling came upon my
heart. It had been somewhat tight when I first
bought it, and now it was very loose. We were
even obliged to wind some silk round it the next day,
to prevent it from falling off.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For three days, happiness seemed to have all the
effect that I had ever attributed to it in my brightest
fancies. Louise was certainly better, and she looked
so happy, so cheerful, walked up and down the passage
hanging on my arm, with a step so much lightened,
that even the old professor caught the infection
of our hopes, and began to talk of future days.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The medicine soon lost its power over the invincible
enemy. We had been married just six days,
and during the three last, Louise had been feebler
again, and very restless at night. The sixth day was
a warm, sunny one. The light shone cheerfully into
our room, and she talked to me of the sweet aspect
of the summer, and made me open the window to
let in the gentle air.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One room of the old professor’s house looked out
upon the ramparts, planted with trees. It was a
large room, seldom used; but Louise asked me to
go in there, and open the windows before she rose,
saying, that she should like to sit and look at the
green leaves.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her father came in before she was dressed, and
when she was ready, we took her out of her room,
with a hand resting on the arm of each, and led her
into that saloon. I had placed an arm-chair for her
near the window, and she approached feebly and seated
herself in it. The air was very balmy: a clear,
sparkling sunshine brightened the foliage: the sky
beyond, was as deep and blue as her own eyes, and
she gazed for an instant, with a look of intense
thought upon the scene before her. Then looking
up in my face as I stood beside her, she placed her
hand in mine, and said—“Very beautiful!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were her last words. The next instant, a
strange, vacant expression came into those deep
thoughtful eyes, a slight shudder passed over her:
she leaned more and more toward me; and I had
just time to kneel by her side, and catch her head
upon my shoulder. I felt one faint breath fan my
cheek—and Louise was gone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was early in the June of 184-. I had been sitting
in a German railroad-car since early morning,
vainly trying to amuse myself in discovering a degree
of singularity in some one of the many passengers
that were picked up at the different stations
between Kehl and Heidelberg. I had taken a seat
in the third class car, expecting there to find a miscellaneous
mingling of the busy classes of Germans;
but, alas, for my entertainment! it was one class too
high—I should have taken the fourth. After I had
chosen a seat as near comfortable as the wooden
benches would admit of, I perceived, to my disappointment,
that I was surrounded by that class of
people, neither high enough nor low enough to be
interesting; every one seemed completely wrapped
up in himself. There was scarcely any conversation,
and each face soon settled in the repose of quiet
German thoughtfulness. Meerschaums ere long
made their appearance out of the depths of profound
side-pockets; and, as far as dependence on my fellow-passengers
was concerned, there was none, to
beguile the tedium of a long journey. A long, heart-felt
pull, a quiet wink of satisfaction thereat, a
somewhat varied fingering of the pipe-bowl to press
the ashes—that was all. Diagonally across the car
and nearly facing me, sat a very pretty girl whom,
from the timid wandering of her deep-blue eyes, I
judged to be unmarried. I watched her some time
to observe where she recognized a protector, but her
eye rested nowhere particularly; it seemed uneasy,
searching, and I concluded she was going but a short
distance, and alone. Just as the train was moving,
a handsome young man stepped in the door, looked
around the car, was recognized by a calming of the
uneasy eyes, and took his seat before them, in the
middle row, turning his back toward me. As he
bent toward her and whispered, she did not smile,
her face seemed too thoughtful; she only gazed in
his eyes and spoke not a word. Ha! thought I, I
see how it is, and settled myself to enjoy a morsel
of sentimentality. My gentleman soon finished his
first course, and then leaned back in his seat to chew
the cud at his leisure. I thought he relished it very
much, for it was full twenty minutes before he made
another motion; during all which time the young
lady did little but gaze at him, it appeared to me,
with perfect satisfaction. After a time the gaze of
satisfaction changed to a look of concern, and finally
of marked uneasiness. She leaned forward, spoke to
him, yet he heeded her not. She arose suddenly,
and I was so absorbed in anxiety that I almost arose
with her. He started as from a lethargy, and darted
to the vacated corner, whilst she quietly took his
seat and I saw her face no more. I still saw the
same blue eyes in the corner, “yet I saw them but
a moment,” for the lids soon closed over them, and I
knew that the kind sister had given up her corner
for the lazy brother to sleep in. “Corn-cobs twist
his hair,” said I, for I was doubly provoked, first, at
his deception, and then, I saw the pretty face no
more. I did not indulge in romance again, but
turned my eyes and my thoughts to the outer world.
The monotony of the company made me stupid; the
prolonged, premeditated winks over the smoking
bowls made me drowsy, and the flitting lights and
shadows of the varied scenery seemed to beckon me
to dreamy lands of wine and song and ghosts and
chivalry. Beyond the green slopes to the eastward,
the Black Forest stretched afar to an immeasurable
distance; mysterious outlines swelled and dwindled
in the darkness; a huge head peered over the tree-tops;
another and another; the ghouls stared at us,
it seemed to me, “more in sorrow than in anger.”
I could not tell why, but their malignity seemed forgotten
in fear and wonder. There was a scream, a
terrific scream—of the locomotive—and pell-mell,
helter-skelter, heels up, head down, away they
darted like a squad of frogs before a bouncing poodle.
I was fully awakened to the surprising loveliness of
the landscape around me, but I had little time to
enjoy it—another scream, a rumble, a series of
jerks, and we were at the—terminus, in Heidelberg.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I was soon in the good care of mine host of the
Hoff, who certainly possesses one of the most desirable
locations and establishments for entertainment
in the world. Close by the railroad depot, it is
about a mile from the town, and a beautiful avenue
leading all the way, is lined with elms and lindens
on either side. On the ascent of a steep hill which
rises abruptly from the town, and about mid-way to
the summit, is the celebrated ruined castle of Heidelberg,
whose lords once swayed the feudal sceptre
over all the surrounding country. The gay conversation
at the <span class='it'>table d’hôte</span> was in strong contrast with
the, not moodiness but apathy, of the railroad car.
A large <span class='it'>musical-box</span>, upon the plan of our pocket
toy of that name, but as large as a good-sized wardrobe—discoursed
sweet music the while. The
company which I found introduction to, was sufficiently
entertaining to withhold me from my contemplated
walk toward the ruins that evening, and the
beautiful promenades in front of the hotel were quite
gay. Early next morning with an agreeable English
party I set out for the castle. As we neared it
along the straight avenue, we advanced farther and
farther from a flank view. The front came slowly
out with its red towers and crumbling battlements,
and the vast structure grew in the majesty of its
ruins. As we approached the foot of the mount, a
road crossed the avenue, leading toward the river to
the left, to the right leading up the mountain. We
ascended a considerable time after having lost sight
of the castle, and as yet, so early was the hour, we
had seen no one astir. No habitation of any kind
was along this road, which, before us, appeared to
descend from the solitude of the hills. We clambered
up, up, up, until at last, said one:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We surely are as high as the castle, and I do believe
we ought to have taken this left-hand road just
below us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, no!” said another, “let us go on and trust
to fortune; for in so beautiful and romantic a place
we cannot go amiss—maybe that we shall make
some grand discovery, too, and then we will jointly
write a book to put it before the world.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The conversation was cut short by a noise up the
road; we looked, and there stood a man leaning
against a tree by the road-side, waiting for his oxen
and cart which were moving slowly down the road
above him. He called to his cattle in a loud voice,
and hummed an air as he leaned back against the
tree again. Just at that moment the piping cry of
a lark rang through the wood, and ere it died away
he peeled forth in boisterous answer—</p>

<p class='line0'>“Ho! for the deep where the sea-bird sings!</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;Ho! for the bowers where his merry voice rings!”</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

</div>

<p class='noindent'>Here, as he perceived us, he halted in his strain and
walked demurely by his cart. In a few words it
was determined among us that we should inquire of
him the road to the castle; but as each one declined
the honor of gaining the information, upon the plea
that perhaps his style of German might be unintelligible
to the unpolite ears of the rustic, I volunteered
the undertaking.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good morning, my friend?” I hailed him. “Be
so good as to tell us the way to the castle.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you wish to see the castle?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is what we have come especially for.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“O, ’tis a magnificent sight!” (and he gazed
fixedly on one of the ladies, a gay young beauty, as
he spoke.) “O ’tis a magnificent sight! No one
can tell better than I how beautiful it is. I have
seen it in the morning when the sun was rising on
it, making its red walls look like gold. I have seen
it in the day, in the evening, and (I’ll tell you) I
have seen it by the bright moonlight when—O, I
have loved every old stone of it dearer than I do my
life! But if you wish to see it, keep the right-hand
road at the first fork, and follow it as far as you can,
and when you come to the bower—Ah, I’ve seen
it in the dark nights, too, curse it! curses on it!</p>

</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Here I lost the words of the boisterous music as
he swung off and hurried to overtake his cart, leaving
us all not a little astonished.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What an eccentric person!” whispered Miss
Thornton to me, the lady who had attracted his gaze
in so marked a manner, and the only lady in the company
who understood German.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah! I see,” said I, “that admiration is never
lost upon a lady, no matter from how humble a
source it come. He was put beside himself, poor
fellow! no wonder he appeared eccentric.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was not that,” she said. “Did you not see
how he changed when he spoke of the arbor, as if
some remembrance associated with it excited him?
No—I think there is or was some one that I look
like. I <span class='it'>would</span> like to see any one that looks like
me, no matter who she be. It’s so unusual, is it
not?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Vain puss!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then how merry he got again,” she continued,
unheeding me. “No, I don’t understand such sudden
changes—without any cause, too. He’s remarkably
fine-looking for one in his condition—I
beg pardon, sir, I wonder what bower he can mean;
I never heard of any on the way to the castle.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nor I, but we shall surely find one; and when
we do, I fear this little incident will engage my imagination
more than the historic associations of the
castle.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>We journeyed on higher and higher, until we
came to the fork of the road. Here nearly all were
inclined to bear away to the left, around the mountain,
fully satisfied that we were high enough. I
explained that the young German had been very
precise in his directions to keep to the right, and all
yielded to him, rather to banter fortune than from
persuasion that we were going the right road. On
we toiled, and the road at last came to an abrupt
termination upon the very summit. A high-road
bore off to the right, that we could trace a mile or
two over the hills, and only a tangled path led toward
the west. Leaving the company to await the
result, I proceeded to explore the path, and soon
came in view of the town lying in the plain below.
I stood enchanted with the scene. A gently sloping
country receded several miles to the Rhine; meandering
all the way through fields and forests, the
legend-consecrated Neckar glistened in the morning
sun, and beyond, the vine-clad hills of France, the
country of the Moselle, crowned the horizon. Far
away to the south could be traced the winding
Rhine almost to its native mountains, and to the
north it was lost among the hills of the Odenwald,
as it widened and straightened onward toward the
plains of Holland. I hailed the party as it came up,
all were amazed at the magnificent landscape, and
each avowed he was well repaid for the toilsome
journey. A few steps farther brought us to a rugged
stair of broken stones, and some ten or twelve
feet below, on a small natural terrace, was an over-grown
<span class='it'>bower</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“O, the bower! the bower!” exclaimed every
one. There it was; and as we reached it, a full
view of the dismantled towers and crumbled walls
of the castle opened below us, almost beneath our
feet. The German was right. He thought we
wished to <span class='it'>see</span> the castle, not to go to it, and we had
gained the finest view of the finest ruin in the North
of Europe. It is not my intention that my pen shall
wander among those most interesting testimonies of
grandeur passed away. Suffice it to say, we returned
home well sated with pleasure, to recruit our
humanity by a very late breakfast at twelve o’clock.
We had walked fasting from six.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From that day the bower became one of my favorite
haunts during the few weeks of my stay in
Heidelberg. One day, with a view to further exploration
of the heights to the eastward of the bower,
a region I had often tried to get a view of from the
Castle Mount, I set out on horseback, and after
reaching the summit, took the road that we had seen
over the hills on our first visit to the castle. For
two or three miles it was nothing but steep hills and
narrow valleys. Not a sound was heard save the
twittering of birds and the tumbling of waters; not
a particle of verdure was to be seen but the dark,
distant forests, and near, the quivering foliage of the
vine as it climbed up, up to the very pinnacles of the
terraced heights. Beyond, the country spread out
into fields and meadows and grass and waving grain.
Farm-houses and villages were clustered about.
Vineyards lingered upon the knolls, and scarce ventured
a distance down the sunny slopes. After a
long day’s ride I was approaching the bower by another
road: the sun was about setting; I was tired
and thirsty; when I was tempted to dismount by a
little streamlet that fell into and ran down the road-side.
An orchard extended from a small cottage to
the road, and the gate was only upon the other side
of the way. I led my horse over, and after hitching
him to the gate-post, was about reaching a harvest-apple
that hung near me, when my attention was
drawn by a small group in front of the cottage door.
An old gray-haired man was sitting upon a bench
watching a young child that was rolling on the grass,
when my appearance put an end to his occupation.
He looked at me with no expression of pleasure,
evidently not relishing so unceremonious an attempt
upon his orchard. I resigned my thieving intention,
and covered the manœuvre by an advance straight
up to the door. A young woman arose and picked
up the child, and then resumed her seat upon the
grass-plat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good evening, my friend,” said I, for his silence
was awkward—“I am very tired and warm with a
long ride, and was tempted by that cool spring and
your shady trees to dismount and take a moment’s
rest. I am glad to take my rest in such good company.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are welcome,” said he. “I perceive you
are a stranger; an Englishman I suppose?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I am not an Englishman; I am come from
a land much farther off than England, and have seen
a great many Germans in my country. I am an
American.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s that he says, Mary?” cried a voice
from within the house. “Tell him Roderick is not
at home; tell him he wont be at home till to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hush! do, mother! The gentleman has not
come for Roderick.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“O, yes he has. He knows Roderick has got
money and wants to spend it. You know—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do hush, mother! It’s a stranger, and what’s
more, it’s an American.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What does he say about Karl? Ask him when
Karl is coming back.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The tears started to the young woman’s eyes;
and as I saw her press her babe to her bosom, I
knew who Karl was. She seemed to struggle with
the question that rose to her lips:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You said, sir, that you have seen many Germans
in America: did you ever see anybody there
from Heidelberg? Did you ever see Karl Wagner
there?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I told her, I never saw Karl Wagner there, and
asked her if Karl might be her husband; which fact
I knew, however, before I asked. She answered,
that he was; that he was living at a place called Buffalo,
and had lately sent her money to take her to another
place called New York, where she would meet
him. Her father was anxious that she should go, but
her mother, who was now doating, would resent the
very mention of it, and was always expecting Karl
to <span class='it'>come home</span>. Her brother Roderick, she said, had
been unfortunate, and was bent on going with her;
but of this, her mother knew nothing. They were
afraid to tell her, her reason was so weak that they
feared she would sink into utter imbecility.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sun was set, and night was drawing on. I
arose to resume my journey, for I was anxious to
reach the foot of the mount before dark; but the old
man offered me a plate of the harvest-apples that had
tempted me, and pressed me to take some supper
with them. If I would only be so kind—they wished
to ask me so many questions about America. I am
not sure that I should have accepted their invitation
had not my eye, as I arose, fallen upon a picture
hanging against the opposite wall of the little room.
A second glance showed the marked and benevolent
features of the old man, looking out from the canvas.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ha—ha!” said he, “that is a fine picture. Step
in the door, and you will see more of them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I did so, and to my surprise, beheld four others
hanging wherever space enough could be found to
contain them. One was the portrait of the old woman
whom I now saw for the first time; another of
Mary, and the remaining two were, a young man apparently
thirty years of age, and a boy of sixteen.
The old man followed me with his eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ha—ha!” said he. “I see you admire them.
Poor Roderick! There are few who can beat him
in his art—but you would not think so to see him
now. These are the last he ever made. He paid his
last tribute to those he loved best.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The old man spoke in a very sorrowful tone. I
began to feel a deep interest in Roderick, whatever
his misfortunes might be.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is not Roderick your son?” I asked, supposing
that I must have made a mistake.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes—that one I suppose you don’t know; that’s
Karl Wagner, that’s Mary’s husband—a good son he
is. And that’s Tommy, that’s our Tommy—sturdy
Tommy, as they call him. That’s the last one Roderick
ever made.” And the old man brushed his
eyes with his shriveled hands as he spoke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where does Roderick live?” I asked. “Is he
married?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hush—here!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why is it, that a young man of such talent gives
up a glorious art, when it opens a field to him to enable
him to rise above his condition, to gain wealth,
honor, fame?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hush!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go, ask Count Reisach!” cried the old woman,
starting up. She was in a frenzy. Her eyes glared,
her bent form trembled from head to foot, her hands
were clenched, but hung dangling at her side, and
she seemed to make superhuman efforts to raise
them. They were paralyzed. Tears coursed each
other down her cheeks as she cried—“Go ask Count
Reisach! Go find him! Go ask poor Father Klaus!
Go down and ask Almighty God why he let—oh!”
she cried, sinking on her knees—her voice choked;
sobs, spasms convulsed her frame; still her face was
raised, it seemed to me in prayer, but her hands
clasped not, they seemed to weigh her to the earth,
as they hung lifeless beside her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mein Got! O, mein Got!” cried the old man,
as he took her in his arms. “O, my poor frau—would
to God thy poor spark of reason would go
out, that I might see this heavy burden off thy
soul!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He raised her tenderly as a child, repelling my assistance,
and when he had placed her in her arm-chair,
left her to Mary’s care, and came to resume
his seat upon the bench, outside the door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She never grieved so for herself, and she has had
her own troubles too. But she knows not all yet—O,
mein Got! mein Got! who will tell her—for he
must, he must, he must!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He closed his eyes—as it were—to shut out so near
a view of misery. A loud voice was heard approaching
in the road, and as it became more distinct, I
started as I recognized the words—</p>

<p class='pindent'>Here the gate flew open, and my acquaintance of
castle memory stalked up the path, followed by a
sturdy lad.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Father, it’s all arranged,” he bawled. “It’s all
arranged. I’ve made up my mind. There are three
in Heidelberg—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Stop, Roderick. You know your mother. See,
too, here is a stranger.” He paused, saluted me as
though he had never seen me before, and turned to
the youth who followed him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where are the cattle, Tommy? That’s right—you
must be smart, you know; remember what’s on
your shoulders!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tommy said he knew, and was going to be smart.
Mary appeared at the door and invited us to supper.
The mother was gone, and the old man seemed relieved
when he missed her, for he looked around the
room, and the cloud left his brow, ere he asked a
blessing on his humble table. After supper he lighted
his pipe; Tommy took his hat and disappeared, and
Roderick touched my arm as he moved toward the
door. His boisterous humor was gone, and he calmly
and mannerly asked me to be seated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She is worse to-night,” he said. “They have
sent Tommy for <span class='it'>him</span>.” After a moment, he continued;
“I recognized you at first, and for my rudeness
I must plead the state of mind I was in. The
truth is, I have this day arranged my departure for
America, to take my sister to her husband; and the
relief from the burden of suspense I had long been in
made me quite forgetful of myself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do not know,” said I, “that you are doing best
in taking this course. You are an artist, and I must
bear witness to the promise of success you make in
your art; but, as I begin to feel a deep interest in
yourself, your family, and—I think I may say with
truth—in your sorrows, for some strange misfortune
seems to brood over this house, I feel at liberty to
remonstrate with you for abandoning what seems to
me your duty to yourself, and your father’s family.
I could not give you hope of better success where
you purpose going than you would probably meet
with here. The best of our own artists reside in Europe,
for we have no models at home. Have you
always lived here with your parents?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Until within the last few weeks I spent most of
my time in the town; my occupation kept me very
much from home. Of late, I have done nothing but
assist my father here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It seems to me that you might assist him more
with your brush than with your ox-goad.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If I could use it perhaps I might; but I can paint
no more here. I am going, and Tommy and I have
trimmed his vines and sown his crops, and when
Tommy shall be able to take care of the vines himself,
I shall be gone.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is where I cannot excuse you. You are
not suffering from poverty; you are not driven to
emigrate; and it is in leaving your infirm parents
when they are bowed down by affliction that I think
you do not do your duty by them. They both seem
proud of you, and still—you appear to love them
as you ought.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The affliction is mine! You were at the bower?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I could go there with you, and tell you a
tale of sorrow that you would never forget. You
cannot judge. I know that my father and my poor,
fond mother grieve—it is for me; but what is their
grief to mine? It is but the reflection of mine; it is
like the cold, borrowed light of the moon—mine, the
scorching sun. I am plunged from heaven into hell!
This spot is to me, now, of all the world, like the
deepest abyss of infernal misery; and, but for Father
Klaus, our good old priest, this shadow of hell had,
ere this, been bartered for the reality. He has kept
alive a spark of reason in me, that I hope may yet
guide me through the world. Here he is—I see they
have sent Tommy for him. She always forgets her
own sorrow, when she sees him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well Roderick, my son,” said the old priest, as
he paused at the door, “I fear you have been imprudent
again. These outbursts of yours will bring
the poor old mother to the grave. You have heard
something since, and it has set you beside yourself,
poor boy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, Father, I have heard nothing since I told you
Count Reisach was in Cologne; that is three weeks
ago, and from that time I have sought no news but
for your sake. The only news I have to tell you is,
that my departure for America is determined upon;
I have made up my mind to go.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s right; that’s right!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You will tell her?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Leave it to me. God will surely temper the
wind; but not to-night, not to-night!” And he
sighed as he entered the house and left us alone
again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The moon was just rising, and as I pressed the
poor fellow’s hand (<span class='it'>poor fellow</span>, I knew he was a
<span class='it'>poor fellow</span>. I pitied him sincerely, but I knew not
why), he returned the pressure warmly, and asked
permission to visit me the following day. I appointed
an hour, and galloped over the hilly road toward
home. As I approached the end of the path that led
off to the bower, I could not help turning my eyes
thither, my mind was full of Roderick, and I could
not disconnect the idea of him from the idea of the
bower. Had I known his story then as I do now, I
could have sighed with the sighing trees, that shook
and sighed all night on the gloomy Castle Mount.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I knew that I had a treat in store for Miss Thornton.
I knew what fresh interest I would awaken,
when I should tell her that the rough peasant was an
accomplished artist. That evening and the next
morning, it was a subject she always recurred to
when we were alone, she would talk of nothing
else, and frequently sought opportunities of conversing
apart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next day, Roderick appeared at the appointed
hour, but his garb was changed. He wore no longer
the coarse clothes of a peasant, and I could not but
observe that his altered exterior harmonized much
better with his bearing, and his intellectual features.
Several of the party who had made with me the
morning excursion to the Castle Mount were still at
Heidelberg, and as we frequently met on our rounds
upon the promenade, <span class='it'>she</span> was the only one, of all,
who recognized my companion. His object seemed
to be to learn, as far as my judgment extended, the
probable prospects that awaited him in the United
States, in the prosecution of his art. He dwelt upon
the subject calmly, and was perfectly self-possessed
until we approached Miss T., when he stopped, and
regarded her with the same fixed gaze that I had remarked
upon our first interview. From that moment
he was a changed person. A strange uneasiness
seemed to take possession of him. His face was
pale, and at last he turned abruptly down the avenue.
I followed him, and cast one look back at her, ere I
started. She and her companion had paused; he
was speaking to unheeding ears, for her gaze was
fixed on us, her face was pale, and wore the expression
of sudden alarm. He led me hastily along the
avenue; I followed, I scarce knew why: but he
could have led me anywhere. After a while—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I cannot tell you,” said he, “until we reach the
bower.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And we began to ascend the mountain. At last,
we pushed aside the briars that blockaded the little,
descending path that led to the bower. The magnificent
ruins appeared spread out below us, and I half
forgot the sorrows of my eccentric friend in lively
feelings of pleasure. After a pause, which I was unwilling
to interrupt (for I saw in his countenance, in
his whole bearing, evidence of a severe interior
struggle), he said—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When I am able to reflect, I know that I am imposing
on your generosity in some way, but I scarce
know how. It is only your goodness which has
prompted you to undergo all this fatigue and trouble;
and now I feel bound, I wish to open my heart to
you, but it seems as though all I can tell you cannot
compensate you. At any rate, it will be a relief to
me, and hereafter it may help the vividness of your
recollections of Heidelberg. I thought I should never
tell this story, or speak this name again; but that lady
recalled, in so many ways, so lively an image of my
lost Ella, that I <span class='it'>must</span> unburden my heart of its excess.
She was the niece of Father Klaus. Her parents
died when she was very young, and the good
old man took her into his own charge. No parent
could have loved her more, or watched over her
with more tender solicitude than he did. As she
grew up, he taught her many things which, but for
him, would have been entirely beyond her reach;
but she repaid him, for an apter scholar never learned,
and never had man a child who loved him more.
She grew to be very beautiful, and was talked of for
her beauty all the country round; but I had won her
heart when it was a child’s, and as we grew up
my only fear in life was for that, and all my efforts
were only for <span class='it'>that</span>. Father Klaus knew how matters
stood nearly as soon as we, and was contented.
When we grew up, he ratified and blessed our betrothal,
and turned his attention to my own prospects.
Through his influence with the old Count Reisach,
I was enabled to enter the academy of Heidelberg,
and, thanks to the count’s generosity and patronage,
I had laid up nearly enough to gain Father Klaus’s
consent to our marriage. The day was fixed; but
nearly a year distant, and the good old man was to
perform the ceremony himself. Often, and often, as
I returned home from town have I turned down this
path, and here was Ella waiting for me, to sit
a while, and then stroll home together. Here
we built this very bower, when we were children,
with our own hands. She chose the place. Here
we would sit and watch the setting sun; and I, as a
proud young artist, would descant to her upon the
harmony of the glowing colors, scarce brighter than
her own bright eyes and glowing cheeks. Here
would we come and spend hours together—she would
bring her needle, and I would sketch the castle, the
mountain, the town, the plain, the forest, and every
object that could afford a pretext for remaining.
Sometimes, when she was very busy, I would gaze,
and gaze into her sweet face and forget every thing
but that. Then she would look up and smile, and
come and bend her head over my shoulder to see the
progress of my sketching, and find the whole sheet
covered over with images of herself, and Ella, Ella,
Ella, scribbled in every form, and ornamented with
every possible device. Then she would steal her
little hand over my eyes, and say I was a ‘lazy, lazy
boy.’ Perhaps, sir, you cannot know why I speak
of these little things, and you may deem them trifling;
but, sir, it is a true saying that life is made up of trifles.
It was so that she wound about me a web that
could not be unwound; all these endearing trifles cannot
be reversed, one by one, and the web uncoiled.
There is but one method of release, and that is, by a
mighty effort to burst the whole fabric—even then,
the shreds will hang about, and float in every breath
of memory. Here, time after time, we repeated our
vows of love and fidelity, and eagerly looked forward
to the day that would crown our happiness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In the meantime Count Reisach died, and his son,
a youth of some twenty years, succeeded to the
estates. He was known ere that time, through all
the land, for his boldness, courtliness and generosity,
courted and sought by all the nobility and gentry—for
he was handsome and rich. Moreover, he was a
connoisseur in almost all the fine arts. I was often
employed by him in copying his paintings for presents
to his friends. Once he induced me to part
with a portrait of Ella, which I was very proud of,
and which he had seen at Father Klaus’s. I often
saw him there. One evening last April, as I was
returning from town, I turned down the path, for I
knew I should meet Ella here. I was startled by a
shriek. I cried, Ella! Ella! In a moment I was
here upon the spot, and she rushed into my arms,
weeping and frightened. To all my questions as to
what had alarmed her, she only sobbed. I seated
her, and examined all about the bower; I thought
of serpents, and searched under rocks, peered over
the bushy precipice, but could discover nothing.
We could not sit and enjoy that evening—she was
agitated, and I led her home. She did not go often
to the bower after that. One evening, it might be
a fortnight after, upon appointment, I came here
again to meet her, and I found her weeping. As
before, I took her home. Another time, she was
not weeping, but seemed silent, thoughtful, depressed.
We went home again. I was puzzled,
pained; I knew not what to think or do, and she
revealed nothing to all my entreaties. She would
not go to the bower any more. At times she wore
a deadly paleness for days, and again she would glow
with a flush, as though a fresh impulse were given
to her life. She was evidently declining. All the
neighbors watched and pitied “poor Ella;” they
pitied Father Klaus, but none knew the extent of
the agony I nursed in secret. When I would beg
her to walk with me to the bower that her and my
childish hands had built, and where we always were
so happy, she would turn pale and tremble—I dared
not speak to her of the bower any more. Frequently
I would detect her eye resting upon me as if in pain,
as though <span class='it'>she</span> pitied <span class='it'>me</span>; a starting tear would glisten
in her eye for a moment, and she would turn away;
immediately she would be as composed as before.
I was pained, shocked; and a presentiment of some
awful calamity seized me. One evening I was detained
in town later than usual. I had been for
several days employed in restoring a painting for
Count Reisach, and the next day would see it
finished. ‘It is not finished yet,’ he whispered. The
count had hurried me to work early and late. It
was a relief to be so busily employed. As I wended
my way up the mountain, I thought of Ella all the
way—I must go to her that evening, tired as I was.
When I came to the end of the path, I could not resist
a moment’s visit to the bower; for since pleasure
there seemed to be henceforth forbidden fruit to
me, I longed for a moment even of its pain. It was
growing dark, and as I brushed past yonder bush, I
thought I saw something move, just where you sit.
I stopped, and distinctly saw the cloaked figure of a
man disappear down that precipice. I rushed forward,
for thoughts of some dark crime crowded
upon me, and I nearly fell upon the prostrate form
of a woman at my feet. I knelt, and raised the head
upon my knees; it was bare, and the dark locks uncoiled
upon the ground.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Here he paused. I never before or since beheld
such a mute picture of agony. He lowered his head
upon his hands, and the big drops fell fast upon the
ground. He tried not to restrain them. At length he
raised his eyes inquiringly, and I feared not to say,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>It was Ella.</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He nodded. After a few minutes, which I indulged
him in without a question or remark, he continued—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I bounded, as if stung by a serpent, and I hurried
to Father Klaus. I told him, I know not what.
Then I hurried home; and for days, they told me, I
raved. When I recovered I learned that they
were gone.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Count Reisach. No traces of them could be
found until within three weeks, when we learned
that they had been in Cologne.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Were they—” I could not finish; he gave me
an inquiring look, and I thought his severe part was
going to be acted again. I had not the heart to
<span class='it'>think</span> of it more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“From that time my poor mother has been a
paralytic, and now we fear her reason is almost
gone. Father Klaus is an older man, but his feelings
are all for others; he is constantly with <span class='it'>her</span>.
Now, do you wonder that I hate this spot, and all
that I can see from here? Here have I known my
happiest and bitterest moments. From this day I
see you no more!” exclaimed he, starting to his
feet, and gazing on the work of his hands: “Here
I bid <span class='it'>an eternal</span>, an eternal farewell to you and—”
He took his pencil and wrote (he would not speak
it)—I looked—“Ella Corbyn.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Her father was an Englishman,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I pressed his hand—“Adieu!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Adieu!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To meet again?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To meet again,” said I; and we parted. As he
disappeared over the brow of the hill, I could hear
the poor fellow trying to lighten his crushed heart
with his boisterous sea-song. The next morning
Mr. Thornton and his daughter left for England.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A few weeks after that I was in Paris. Months
rolled by; September was come, and Roderick’s
story had nearly slipped from my mind. One fine
evening I was sauntering along the Champs Elysées,
where one is sure to see at that time, all the notables
that may be luxuriating in the French capital; when
I recognized in a gay equipage the beautiful features
of Miss Thornton. She was paler than when
I had seen her last, but still very beautiful. I watched
her some moments, to catch her eye; and when she
did look toward me, I took the liberty of saluting
her. She flushed, and turned her head aside, but did
not acknowledge the salutation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So much for my impudence,” said I; and I
saluted no one else that evening.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A day or two after, I was dining with some friends
at Vantini’s. Opposite us at the table d’hôte, were
two vacant chairs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We are unfortunate to-day,” said my friend,
“for I was anxious you should see a very pretty
English girl who sits opposite. Clara,” said he,
turning to his wife, “what is the name of our little
beauty across the table? I never can think of it, for
I can’t help calling her Miss Mary.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh,” said Mrs. F., “I wish you to know them—so
agreeable; and going on a tour through the
United States. They are a Mr. and Miss Thornton—father
and daughter; and as you are going soon, I
do wish you could go together.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So, so!” thought I; “here is a little bit of adventure
if they only come in.” And I consoled myself
with the thought that I could not come out
of it worst. Soon a couple of servants ushered a
lady and gentleman along the hall, and Mr. and Miss
Thornton appeared before me, she glowing with
health and beauty. They both greeted me warmly,
which somewhat astonished my friends as well as
myself. I was taken aback, but I had been not a
little nettled, and was determined not to be outdone,
so said as little as I could.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why!” said Mrs. F., “you are old friends,
then! All my anxiety was thrown away!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I supposed we were,” said I, “until last Tuesday
evening.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Last Tuesday evening!” exclaimed Miss T.
“Why, what happened? You puzzle me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Merely that I took the liberty of recognizing <span class='it'>an
old friend</span>, and was <span class='it'>cut</span>—that’s all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You puzzle me still more. Where were you at
the time?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Below the place d’étoile.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you sure it was on Tuesday?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perfectly sure.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She burst into a laugh, and her father smiled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It must have been the longest cut I ever gave
in my life. I only wish I <span class='it'>could</span> cut that far off—I
know some who should suffer”—and she laughed
again. “It’s the first time I ever heard of a sane
gentleman, standing in the Champs Elysées, to take
off his hat to a lady in Brussels.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The laugh was decidedly against me, and we were
soon on the best of terms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That night a new train of thoughts engaged me.
Poor Roderick’s story returned, and the memory of
his grief with all its thrilling intensity. <span class='it'>Had I seen
Ella?</span> It must be. That pale, thoughtful, <span class='it'>hiding</span>
countenance could be only hers. Poor Roderick!
I feel for you deeply! I wonder if your sorrow feels
any alleviation in your new country! I fear not.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next day I made sufficient inquiry to certify
me that I had seen Count Reisach, and with him,
Ella. I saw them once again, it was for a moment,
and she seemed paler still; as I gazed, again she
turned her face away. Poor Ella! how she shrank
from the eyes of men! There was a deep remorse
preying upon that wasting beauty; a secret sorrow
and shame blighting every bud of pleasure and of
hope. How bitter will thy end soon be, poor trusting,
fragile daughter of Eve!</p>

<p class='pindent'>I saw them no more. I walked every day with
Miss Thornton to show her the lady that she so
closely resembled; but we did not see them. They
were probably seeking new scenes to beguile her
short life of its fleeting days.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A few weeks after, we were in Havre, awaiting
the sailing of the first packet ship for New York.
We had determined to “go together,” as Mrs. F.
had desired, and our rooms were taken in the
Zurich, one of the fleetest of the line. At that time,
a line of French government steamships was plying
between Havre and New York; and one, which
was advertised to sail on the day we arrived, was
to be detained some ten days, to undergo a repairing
of machinery. Havre is the great port of emigration
for the French, German, and Swiss emigrants;
and the French steamships, offering low fares and
speedy passage, generally sailed with their between-decks
well filled with emigrant passengers. On this
occasion, some two hundred poor creatures had engaged
passage upon the detained vessel, and few had
the means to await in Havre her postponed day of
departure; consequently there was a rush upon the
office of the sailing packets. We went aboard about
3 o’clock, P. M. The lower deck was crowded
with steerage-passengers; and a single glance sufficed
to show that they were three-fourths Germans. I
could not help wondering how many of the two
hundred poor emigrants below me, I might have
seen before, as I journeyed through their country a
few months ago. Many a one, I thought, I might
have seen before his cottage door, or through the
window of his work-shop, ere poverty had <span class='it'>at last</span>
decreed, that he <span class='it'>must</span> go to the land beyond the
seas, far from his fatherland.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The ship was moving from the dock. The crowds
upon the piers cheered us on. The stars and stripes
sprung into the breeze. O, how my heart bounded
to feel again the protection of my country’s flag!
The first time, for years, did the feeling of <span class='it'>home</span>
thrill through my bosom: and tears of patriotic love
and pride rushed to my eyes. <span class='it'>I</span> was going <span class='it'>home</span>;—there
<span class='it'>they</span> stood in melancholy groups, gazing
their last on land contiguous to their own, upon the
receding shores of the old world. The tri-colors in
the distance soon faded into one indefinable hue.
The green hills of Normandy came forth once again;
but “twilight gray soon in her sable livery all things
clad;” and we were away, away upon the sea.
After tea, we all came upon deck. The last loom
of the land was fading away; and my thoughts and
feelings, memory and fancy, were busy with home
before, and the friends and associations I was leaving
behind—perhaps forever. I was overflowing
with expectation and regret. Miss T. stood beside
me, kindly hearkening to my outpouring feelings.
The emigrants were all below, save a few scattered
ones, and a larger group gathered about the fore-mast.
They were leaving country, home, kindred,
all, to seek a refuge in a foreign land: I was leaving
friends that I had made in many lands; countries
and scenes made dear to me by long and intimate
association; returning to a home wherein death had
made sad changes during my long sojourn: she was
going on a trip of pleasure, and present enjoyment
was her occupation. Suddenly I heard an exclamation—“Oh!”
and I thought she was taken ill. I
looked, and she was pointing to the group around
the mast; I saw and recognized a face I could never
forget. We continued to gaze in astonishment.
The few women who were there were all in tears;
one, whose head was bowed upon her knees, sobbed
violently. The men were drinking farewell to Fatherland,
and many an absent friend and fair, was
pledged by name. Then there was a cry for “a
song!” “a song!”—“Let’s have a song from Roderick!”
Immediately there pealed out those boisterous
but musical tones that I had heard before, far
away from there. My heart thrilled as I listened.
Every voice hushed. Even the sailor, as he trod
the deck, paused to listen to that fine, deep voice, as
it rang through the ship.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the last sound died away upon the water, the
singer caught sight of me, and the fair girl beside
me, and disappeared from the deck. The listeners,
as they dispersed to their several meditations, took
up the words of the song; each one whatever best
suited his feelings at the time. It was strange to
read the various echoes as they rebounded spontaneously
from the hearts of the emigrants. When the
air of the song was forgotten the words were not,
and each sang or mumbled them to music of his
own—sometimes wild and pretty, sometimes discordant
enough. One would long for</p>

<p class='noindent'>and I thought I could read in his furrowed face
traces of a life of penury and suffering. He was
going with a lightened heart, transplanted in his decaying
age. But by far the greater part dwelt upon
the memory of their forsaken homes and kindred;
their thoughts were gazing afar upon “the shadow
on the ever-green hills.” Ere long they had nearly
all disappeared, gone to their crowded chamber to
be rocked asleep. Only a few women remained
beneath the suspended lantern, seated by the mast.
The one I had noticed weeping, had not raised her
head during all this time. When she did raise it,
she looked up to heaven and her face shone with religious
fervor. The tears still flowed as she breathed
her heart-felt prayer. I could see every movement
of her lips, and I alone perhaps, of all who saw,
could tell the source of every tear that flowed. I
felt awed, unconscious of myself. My whole being
seemed merged in the intensity of hers. A supplication
sprang unbidden to my lips for the paralytic
mother, for the gray-haired father, in their utter,
utter loneliness; for it was Mary with her baby on
her bosom. She spoke calmly, slowly, solemnly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next day Roderick did not appear upon the
deck; in truth there were very few who did. After
indulging him a few days, which I charged to account
of sea-sickness, and still not seeing him, I
found my way into the steerage, and found the poor
fellow more sick in mind than in body. He had
spent the greater part of his money in trying to
drown his grief; and now that he thought he had
nearly succeeded, he looked none the better for the
success. That face, he said, so like <span class='it'>hers</span>, he could
not escape from now; he must remain near it for
days, weeks. He could almost curse the ill-favored
steamship, whose delay had not only doomed him
to the crowded steerage of the packet, but to weeks
of torture he could not escape from. He would not
appear at all upon deck, and the air of the between-decks
was almost poisonous. In a few days he was
confined to his berth with a burning fever. I had
confided to Miss Thornton every thing, except the
history of Ella, which I disguised in such a way as
not to diminish her sympathies for the invalid. One
day, to my great astonishment, she had, with her
father, gone to minister to him, and spoke with gladness
of the better condition she had left him in. He
talked to her very tenderly of Ella. They went,
she and her kind father, to visit him every day. I
saw how the fire was consuming him, and endeavored
to interpose. I told Mr. Thornton every thing,
all; but they did not see his condition as I did.
Whenever I would go, strange! he would always
beg me not to let them delay coming; but he was
so exhausted with fever, that I attributed this wonderful
change, rather to imbecility or delirium, than
to a change of resolution. Poor Mary was always
by her brother’s side: even her poor babe lay neglected
for him. More than a fortnight he lay in this
miserable condition; yet I was more than sorry
when I felt in his pulse the returning slow beat of
health, and saw his eye calm into quiet enjoyment
of the congratulations which poured in upon him.
I was shocked. It is true a mountain of misery
was moved away, but his <span class='it'>reason was gone</span>.
Miss Thornton went once again to visit him, only
once: and I shall never forget her look of agony and
self-reproach as she returned rather hastily to her
room. I never knew what passed at that interview.
Perhaps she saw for the first time, that while she
deemed she was soothing his misery by her presence,
she had fed it to madness. He rapidly recovered
and seemed happy, for he always smiled
when he asked me why the captain kept Ella
locked up in the cabin and sent her tender messages—<span class='it'>which
I dared not give</span>. The last I ever saw of
him was in New York, when I was about to leave
the ship. A young man came aboard as we hauled
up to the wharf, and I knew from the portrait I had
seen <span class='it'>in the cottage in Germany</span>, that it was Karl
Wagner. He soon found them; and the last I saw
of poor Roderick, as I went ashore, he was unfolding
to the astonished Karl a scheme he had to get
Ella away from the captain, whilst poor Mary hung
upon her husband’s arm, her heart bursting with joy
and grief.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;'>——</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>ELLA CORBYN.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Be it remembered that Roderick, in speaking to
me on the Mount of Heidelberg Castle, said—“Her
father was an Englishman.” It was true. He was
the younger son of a noble English house, though
Ella lived until her twentieth year unconscious of
the fact. She knew he was an Englishman, she
knew he had been a soldier, but of his family she
knew nothing. Better far had it been for her had
she remained forever in ignorance of every circumstance
of her ancestral distinction, or had she had
some other instructor than he who craftily sowed
the seeds of pride and discontent, that he might reap
a glowing harvest of the charms of a lovely woman,
to her soul’s utter desolation. By night and by
stealth, like the Evil One, did he sow tares among
the richest grain, among a perfect luxuriance of womanly
virtues; by day, too, like the husbandman
when the time of the harvest comes, did he pluck
up weed and fruit, did he trample on pride and virtue,
and cast them forth together to wither under
the scorching solstice of remorse and shame. He
tore away the flower and left the stem to die. Poor,
poor Ella! the only jewel of both soul’s and body’s
inheritance was charmed away—what wonder then
that both should droop in poverty, or that, making
common friendship from common desolation, these
mutual foes, the only ones religion ever made, should
compromise to each other the loss of both health
and principle, in fatal reconciliation and despair!</p>

<p class='pindent'>The father of Ella Corbyn, an officer in the British
army, was disabled in action during the Peninsular
war, and after the peace of 1815, retired to the
continent, where he married the beautiful Katrina
Klaus, supported himself and Katrina many years on
his half-pay, until about the period of Ella’s birth,
when he and the half-pay departed together. His
daughter, of course, had no recollection of him, and
never possessed more than the one single article of
his property, a miniature on ivory, of a lady, young,
but by no means beautiful. She never knew who
it was; her mother could not tell her when she first
gave it into little Ella’s tiny hands, but supposed it
was some one of Mr. Corbyn’s family, probably a
sister—and so the matter rested for the while. The
neighbors could tell her scarcely any thing of her
father; they had seen him when he first came into
the neighborhood, but his marriage with his beautiful
wife, and subsequent removal to a neighboring
village, followed so quickly, that they could give no
account of him, nor further description than that of
his personal appearance. Of the circumstances attending
his death all they knew was, that two
strangers stopped one afternoon at the public-house,
that Mr. Corbyn spent part of the evening with
them and went home early; the next morning he
was shot in a duel, but the old captain who stood his
friend in the affair, thought it no business of his to
inquire what the difficulty was about. He left no
property of any value, and his widow supported
herself and Ella on her little patrimony four years
longer, when she, too, died and left the child a helpless
orphan. This was the time for her uncle, the
priest, to come to her assistance. He took her into
his care and provided for her early education by consigning
her to the Sisters of Charity in Cologne.
Here she remained five years; and when her good
uncle, deeming that he could, with better justice to
his finances, superintend her further progress at
home, took her back, she displayed so much ability
and judgment that she soon reigned, a little queen,
over his modest household.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ella was in truth a lovely child. In her earlier
days, when she played alone by the road-side, before
the priest’s lawn, not a stranger passed but stopped
to take a second look at that bright, spiritual little
face, gazing half-smilingly, half-pensively, half-hidden
beneath dark ribbons of straying locks. Her
complexion was exceedingly fair, not blonde; her
features, not classical, were <span class='it'>petits</span> and regular; her
face sufficiently full, but playful every where—a
pretty child: but from almost infancy the striking
characteristic of her face was <span class='it'>soul</span>; never did it appear
inanimate, never did it lack character—even in
her sleep the marked corners of the softly-closed
lips and little, dimpled brow, betokened self-possession;
but when she smiled, a perfect sunshine of
thought and feeling overspread her countenance, and
she was irresistibly beautiful. As might be expected,
the five years’ tuition she had enjoyed had
developed the intellectuality of her beauty apace
with the cultivation of her mind, and wherever and
whenever a childish passion lay suppressed by growing
religious principle, its disappearance gave place
upon her countenance to the sublime, triumphant
sentiment that crushed it. Mr. Klaus, or as he was
termed by his parishioners, Father Klaus, was passably
skilled in music; and under his systematic instruction
Ella soon became the most accomplished
vocalist in his country-choir. The old Count Reisach
had, in church, frequently heard and appreciated
the superior qualities of her voice, and after
a few Sundays, called at the parsonage to pay his
compliments in person to the young singer whom
fame had already made so conspicuous. Little
Ella, when summoned into the presence of the
count, made her courtesy modestly but not diffidently,
and he, charmed with the graces of her person
and behavior, took pains immediately to win upon
her confidence, so that she soon sang to him all her
prettiest songs; whilst Father Klaus sat smiling by,
perfectly happy in the joy of his triumph. When
the old nobleman arose to depart, he stood with his
hand upon the child’s glossy head, and declared he
never <span class='it'>saw</span> such a singer; then, as he turned up to
his gaze that little face so beaming with beauty and
intelligence, he promised by the faith of his knighthood
that next Sunday should see her talent well
rewarded. Next Sunday afternoon arrived a large
case for Ella. How she danced to see it opened!
and when it was opened, how she danced and clapped
her hands around one of the prettiest harps that
ever was seen! This was an era in her life. Every
day would see her and her uncle before the parlor
window blundering over the harp-strings, often in
vain attempts to puzzle out an accompaniment. It
was a new instrument to him as well as to her.
Time, however, and perseverance can conquer all
things, and ere two months were past, Ella might
be seen every evening seated beneath a linden that
shaded the cottage door, gracefully sweeping her
harp in accompaniment of the wildest songs of her
Fatherland; anon would she lift her melting eyes to
heaven as she touched the trembling chords to the
softer melody of a Virgin’s evening hymn. The old
priest would be absorbed in his breviary, as he paced
the graveled walk; he had long since given up the
race, and the little scholar had left him immeasurably
behind. It was not wonderful that Ella became
the admired of all the country around even at that
early age: but she bore her honors so becomingly,
with so much modesty and simplicity, that—wonderful
to say—there was not one among her companions
who did not love her. She was so gentle
and so good.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the <span class='it'>Bower of Castle Mount</span>, I said that Roderick
told me that Father Klaus was aware of the
growing attachment between him and Ella, almost
as soon as themselves. In this, two circumstances
may seem strange—first, that she, educated, accomplished,
admired, courted, should fancy a poor, plain,
hardy country-lad like Roderick; and secondly, that
her uncle should approve and encourage her in such
a fancy. Roderick’s family was very humble,
scarcely above a peasant’s condition; but in this
regard she placed herself upon a perfect equality
with him, and never gave the matter much consideration.
The truth is, she had loved him with a
childish love before she knew that there existed any
other. The first summer after she returned from
Cologne, regularly every Saturday afternoon or festival
eve, would he come to help her gather flowers
for the altar. This office of decking the altar is
only performed by the hands of virgins, and when
one enters into the state of matrimony she no longer
takes her place among the servants of the sanctuary.
Our young pair (he was but four years older than
she) would wander off to the woods together, and
Roderick would climb the highest rocks for moss, or
some stray flower blooming alone; and carry the
heavy basket. At times he would strip off his shoes,
and, Paul and Virginia-like, stagger with his beloved
burden across the streams. When evening approached,
he would mock the squirrels, the partridges,
the wood-robins and the katy-dids, and put
the whole forest in tune before its time, to Ella’s
ineffable delight. Often, when he had doffed his
jacket and thrown it down for her to sit upon, would
he recline upon his arm, his hat drawn over his
brow, pensive and melancholy; and sometimes a
tear would trickle down, as the truth forced itself
upon him, that, despite their intimacy, fortune, and
fortune only, had placed an insurmountable barrier
between him and the idol of his thoughts and dreams.
He would beg her to love him, and she would readily
answer that she did love him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Better than all the other boys?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, better than all the other boys.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Still he was not satisfied. He felt that she did not
mean the same kind of love that he did; he was
doubtful even if she knew any thing about it. How
should he ascertain? He could not ask her if she
would marry him: no, that would be breaking the
ice of a new and unfathomable current, and he might
lose the tenure of the ground he then possessed;
besides, he felt a secret, indefinable shame, and
could not proffer the words. He looked very wo-begone.
Ah! he had it at last.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He did not mean <span class='it'>like</span>, he meant, did she <span class='it'>love</span> him
better than all the other boys?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yes, she loved him better; she said so before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The secret of his new discovery was burning; he
blushed. At last it came.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Did she love him better than all the <span class='it'>girls</span>?</p>

<p class='pindent'>The poor boy was breathless.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yes, she thought she loved him better than all the
<span class='it'>girls</span>?</p>

<p class='pindent'>The mighty weight had turned out a feather; he
knew no more than he did before. Many a time
did the poor fellow try to hit the mark from afar off,
but always with the same success. He persevered
with the same affectionate devotion, her very slave;
and it was not until several years after, when he became
assured of more than one suitor’s rejection, that
he summoned courage to address her plainly, and
received an answer to his heart’s content.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That Father Klaus approved the betrothal of Roderick
and his niece, may not seem wonderful. He
knew him to be the son of pious parents, a boy of
good principle and good capacity. He had often
seen at his father’s house, pasteboard horses, cows,
cottages, and even pencil sketches, that he amused
himself with, when once recovering from a severe
illness. When the boy recovered he frequently
brought into request his newly-discovered capacity,
and improved very much in his rough sketching.
He had no idea of prosecuting his ability any further.
All this was not lost on the priest, who felt
assured that he could command the necessary influence
to enter Roderick in the academy of Heidelberg,
and enable him to become the master of an
honorable and lucrative art. He knew that capacity
is more unfailing, and possesses more resources
than wealth; he knew Roderick’s substantial worth
and undoubted probity, and felt that he had neither
right nor inclination to thwart his niece’s predilection.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was during one of these flower-hunting excursions
that Roderick and Ella first conceived the idea
of weaving the bower on the Castle Mount. They
were accustomed frequently to extend their rambling
to the ruined castle, in the old garden of which
a variety of flowers were still cultivated by the
guardian of the place; and by the time they had
clambered up to the terrace on their return, were
fain to sit down and repose awhile. They soon
began to feel a partiality for the place; and no
wonder, for there was not so fine a view, even to
childhood’s eyes, to be found in the whole country.
Their childish hands there twined the bower whose
strange demolition I, in after years, witnessed. There
they spent many of their happiest hours; there they
first plighted their troth; there they renewed it over
and over again; and there poor Roderick first saw
the—beginning of the end.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It were useless to attempt to say how proud the
poor boy was of his betrothed, and of her accomplishments.
The fact that he never felt a pang of
jealousy during four long years, frequently under
most trying circumstances, that his trust in his beloved
never for a moment wavered till his heart
was wrung, and his brain was crazed that eventful
evening at the bower, loudly testifies to his ingenuousness,
and the priest’s correct estimate of the man.
A neighboring Curé, who had in former years been
a fellow-student of Father Klaus in Italy, frequently
rode over to spend half a day. On such occasions
Ella was entertained with metaphysical disquisitions,
which, unknown to her entertainers, her deep, psychological
nature eagerly drank in, in draughts as great
as her capacity would admit. To their theological
discussions she was a silent, attentive listener; subjects
which her uncle never upon any other occasion
spoke of in her presence, were argued with an
earnestness that made him forgetful of the indirect
injury they might work upon her mind. She began
to propound questions to herself, and to attempt the
solution of them, of herself. She remembered many
delicate cases of morality determined by learned
heads; pondered over the principles upon which
those decisions were based; constructed new cases
for the application of similar principles; in short,
became a blundering casuist before she knew it.
A new light was dawning upon her mind; she saw,
for the first time, that laws can be stretched to very
tension, and not broken. She did not reflect that
principle is firm as a rock, and lasting and unchanging
as eternity itself—that there is no going and returning
there. She knew not that he who ranges
about to strain the utmost limits of law, has wandered
far from the moral centre of gravity—principle.
She knew not that we do not always stand guiltless
in the forum of our own conscience, though no other
living being dare censure us, even in his inmost
mind. The world may judge a man for what he
does and dares; he alone, for what he does <span class='it'>not fear</span>.
Ella was precisely in that unfortunate state of mind,
in which one knows just too much or too little; in
which a certain degree of knowledge necessarily requires
more to prevent its running astray. There
is a degree of pride which renders one ridiculous,
contemptible; a greater degree checks its manifestation—governs
it. One is vanity; the other despises
vanity. Such a relation did Ella’s science
bear to true philosophy as vanity does to pride;—<span class='it'>and
she played with it</span>. One must, one will destroy the
other. Had her uncle known her infatuation, one
word would have dispelled every shadow of it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Oftentimes the college friends would turn their
conversation to days long past, to reminiscences of
their sojourn in Italy. The lore of classic and romantic
associations of that wonderful country; the
graphic illustrations of life, and scenes, and elegance,
and delights, in that delicious clime, enchanted their
young listener. Dissertations on the political changes
there enacting; surmises of changes impending,
necessarily drew forth a detail of social, historic and
scenic minutiæ, that expanded her young mind to
poetic conceptions; distance lent its enchantment to
the view, and her rich fancy glowed with the beauty
of its imaginings. A longing, secret and subtle at
first, then craving and irrepressible, to taste the
sweets of forbidden fruit, took possession of her.
She was betrothed at that time; she knew that with
Roderick she could not enjoy those pleasures; she
ought and did know that this longing would breed
discontent;—hence the subtle manner of its entering
on possession of her heart. Long she repelled it;
principle forbade it; her reasonings were very nice;
and lax as she may have become speculatively, she
nourished a high-minded honor that would have
done credit to any child of Adam. Soon she thought
it no harm to enjoy the victory she had, with so
great an effort, gained over herself; frequently she
did so. Then her sophistry came to the attack; she
might have regrets in secret, she thought, and they
might not be at all detrimental to her husband’s happiness;
hers would be the only loss, the only pain,
if pain there were;—and she let her longing take its
way. Still, she loved her betrothed as much as ever,
none the less on that account; it is true she became
a shade more thoughtful, not quite so light-hearted
as she was, but she did not notice any change. If
her heart lost any of its feeling, her harp did not.
She took it more rarely; her touch was bolder, and
still more delicate; a beautiful originality undulated
more in her modulations, and she played more without
the words than she ever did before. Her spirit
was more self-dependent. There was something
of the wild energy of insidious despair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>About this time the younger Reisach was summoned
from England to attend his father, who was
very ill. Soon the good old count died, and his
heir entered upon the title and estates, in a manner
so becoming and consistent with filial affliction, that
every one said the young count was quite equal to
the old one. The rougher field sports he had been
accustomed to in England were now abandoned, and
he lent his mind to the more quiet and refined German
tastes. Study, poetry, music, painting, sculpture,
divided his attention; he aimed at conciliating
and winning all, the little as well as the great, and
no undue ostentation had place in the details of his
establishment. Regular and attentive at church, he
gained the confidence and esteem of pastor as well
as flock. Refined and delicate in his speech, no
virtuous peasant-girl shrunk from his attention whenever
he thought proper to bestow it. To the <span class='it'>reunions</span>
at the mansion the Curé had a standing invitation;
and in return, the young nobleman strolled
out upon many a welcome call at the parsonage. It
would be harsh, it would be unjust, to say that Count
Frederick commenced his attentions there with any
deliberate design of wrong. Ella’s harp and voice
were frequently brought into request for his passing
entertainment, and he was not sparing of his eulogiums
upon them. He soon began to experience deeper
and more lasting sensations than the momentary
pleasure she intended; no one could do otherwise.
In his presence Ella conversed little, but that little
was full of refinement, of thought and taste. He felt
it difficult to smother his feelings or restrain them;
and although he strictly maintained the distinction
in their conditions, in his intercourse with her, and
knew that a violent death must await all his more
tender sentiments toward her, still he was unwilling
to deprive himself of the pleasure he enjoyed in her
presence. He was deeply in love with her, and he
knew it; yet supposed that, like many other impressions
he had experienced, it would soon pass away,
that he might as well enjoy it whilst it lasted;—no
one would ever be the wiser in the end.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was before, and about this time, that Roderick
and Ella were accustomed to spend their hours, and
almost days together, at the bower. She had grown
into womanhood, had entered into her twentieth
year; and it was on her last birth-day, that she and
Roderick had knelt before her uncle, to receive his
blessing on their betrothal. Roderick had finished
his course in the academy, and had already acquired
his quota, both of fame and money, in painting.
Ella sincerely loved him; and despite the admiration
she felt for the young count, would have been
supremely happy could she have been promised the
realization of her imaginary enjoyments by his side.
She loved him more when in his presence than when
away. Absence threw no enchantment around him;
it was in the sunshine of his tenderness and devotion
that she felt the full glow of her affection for him;
at other times she would feel the chilly mingling of
her regrets. Had they been married then, they
would have been very happy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I said, Count Frederick deemed his love for Ella
to be harmless, and that he felt no scruples in giving
full play to it. It was only when, in his frequent
rides, he caught a glimpse of the lovers enjoying their
honest happiness under their own vine and fig-tree,
as one might say, that the demon of envy, then of
jealousy, took possession of him. There are few
who can look unmoved on the unalloyed happiness
of others, nor feel one pang of envy; that can see
the appropriation by another of a secretly-coveted
object, even an object one has no right or title to, or
expectation of, and feel no sting of jealousy. Thus
was it with Count Frederick: from the window of a
mansion he frequently visited in Heidelberg, he
could look right up to the bower. In the recess of
that window he frequently sat; and with glass in
hand, following with his eye every movement of the
doomed pair, he conjured up a host of demons to torment
him. He knew that her faith was given to
another; he was aware and resolved that he could
not marry her; yet, the long and constant dwelling
of his thoughts upon her, the enlistment of his feelings
and affections for her, seemed, in his disordered
mind, to invest him with an indefinable title; he felt
the outrage done to it, and casting full rein to both
anger and passion, vowed to wreak his vengeance
on what he thenceforward dreamed to be his mistress,
and her lover.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Alone, and in secret, did he plot his plans to circumvent
them. Lost now to every feeling of shame
and honor, he repelled no scheme, however base,
that presented itself; and though the better and more
manly exercise of his faculties drooped and withered
under his scorching passion, a deeper, deadlier cunning
than he ever knew before, sweltered and forged
unceasingly the most crafty implements for his hellish
purpose. He would trust not an iota to the assistance
of other hands, but assumed the whole burden of
contriving and executing upon himself. Not a breath
did he breathe of his infamous design to human ears.
His demeanor in public possessed all the semblance
of urbanity and good feeling that he once felt; but
his interior Vulcan reposed not from his craft.
Every piece of information that he could unsuspectingly
acquire concerning either poor Roderick or
Ella, he stored up and revolved in his aristocratic
mind, digesting it with his moral venom, as a viper
would revolve and masticate with poison its loath-some
morsel. He learned from many sources, partially
from herself, the particulars of Ella’s history,
as far as was known; and contrasting several portions
with certain circumstances that had fallen under
his observation when in England, was astonished
at the result of his machinations, which now doubled
upon himself, to involve him too in their fatal entanglement.
Thus far he had stood apart, aloof, as it
were, upon a height above his contemplated victims.
His baser passions had thrown aside the drapery of
virtue and honor which once veiled the lovely woman
from the gaze of rude thought, and he could
look down upon her very graces as an object of his
intended prey; but when the artful interlocking of
his web and woof turned up to his astonished eyes,
in gathered forms, the whole and real picture of his
contemplated deed; when his study brought to
light the astounding fact that Ella could claim
close kindred with the proudest titles of the
British peerage, his craven spirit of profligacy
slunk away, for the time awed, but not quelled, by
the air of reverence, and veneration that breathed
upon it. At its return, elevated, softened, warmed,
but not purified, by its admixture of romance, he felt
his sternest anger giving way, his haughtiest pride
tottering, his very soul melting into admiration and
love; he reeled from his position aloof, and writhed
a whole burnt offering among the other victims to
his passion. His subtle ingenuity soon brought to
the crucible the extraordinary change in his sentiments
toward the unconscious girl, and the analysis
did not dispel the new charm that enveloped her.
He saw it was perfectly natural, and the only fruit
of his discovery was a resolution to bring the charm
to operate upon her own mind—it would open the avenue
to a secret discontent with her present position,
unfold a vast and snare-beset field to the vagaries of
a romantic imagination, and bring her feelings to a
sympathetic appreciation of the fellowship of caste
that existed between her and himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Full of this dark resolve, Count Frederick went
forth alone one afternoon. He had designedly employed
the unsuspecting Roderick to restore some
old paintings that had accumulated the dust of ages.
They were in a studio in town. There Roderick
had labored busily all the day, and when evening
drew near he was still detained by some management
of the count, in order to give his lordship the
opportunity for his coveted interview with Ella.
He had learned at what hour she would probably
be at the appointed rendezvous, and timed his evening
excursion accordingly. It was a beautiful
afternoon in April. From the castle heights, the sun
was seen slowly creeping down the skies of France,
and the changing tints of the glittering clouds, were
gorgeously reflected by the distant waters of the
Rhine, and the intermediate mirrors of the Neckar.
Villages, hamlets, cottages, spread over the plain,
rolled their black smoke in heavy volumes against
the green mountains, about whose feet the lights
and shadows already had begun to sketch fantastic
tableaux. How naturally did the words of the Mantuan
poet’s pastoral seem to spring to Count Frederick’s
lips, as he stood within a few paces of the
bower, gazing abroad upon the scene, observed by
the startled inmate, and feigning not to observe
again. Ella understood perfectly well the words of
the text, and as they were feelingly and eloquently
poured forth, as though spontaneously, by the handsome
youth, as he threw himself upon the turf, lost
her surprise in the appropriate beauty of the poet’s
effusion—</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>The last two lines he rapturously repeated several
times, then turning his eyes, as though perchance
toward the bower, he hastily arose, and in a moment
stood blandly before Ella, apologizing for his intrusion,
and in the same breath requesting the favor of
one of her pastoral songs. She challenged him for
a repetition of the verses, and he uttered them in so
off-hand, theatrical a way, that they both burst into
a laugh. The ice was broken. Never before had
he so far descended from his dignity in her presence.
There and alone with him, she felt the charm of
this novelty, and bandied words with him willingly,
for she supposed that Roderick would soon come,
and she thought it would be fine to pique his jealousy
a little, only to reward it the better afterward with
the sweetness of perfect tranquillity. He gradually
drew forth from her own lips what little she knew
of her father’s history and family, and artfully beguiled
away the key to her enjoyments and her regrets.
He had been intimate, very intimate, he told
her, with a nobleman in England, whom he now
knew must be her uncle. The identity of her father’s
history, even to his fall in a duel, with that of a brother
of Lord B.; the same name, even a perceptible
resemblance of Ella to him, rendered his assurance
doubly sure. Then followed many particulars
which completely set Ella’s willing mind at rest in
regard to the nobility of her parentage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So far, all was well. As he anticipated, the disclosure
was to her astounding and pleasing at the
same time. The shadows of incredulity that for a
moment hovered before the citadel of her happiness,
flitted away before the march of pleasurable emotions.
Her first feelings were those of gratitude,
and in the liveliness of her satisfaction, as he poured
into her ears the minuter details of her family history,
she could have smiled almost any thing, looked
almost any reward for him who bore her the welcome
tidings. She divined the emotion that quivered
on his lip, fathomed the eloquence that sparkled in his
eye, suffusing his whole face with its light, and trembled,
trembled like an aspen, with momentary terror:
but, as his glowing speech expatiated on the time-honored
and world-worshiped glory and privileges of
the <span class='it'>noblesse</span>, the spirit of high-toned chivalry that
begot, that chose, that ever ornamented the knightly
order of Christendom, her terrors flew to the winds,
and left her trembling frame a play-thing in the frenzied
hands of wilder discord than her bosom had
ever known. She no longer shunned his gaze; their
eyes met again and again; a shadow, as of a dream,
passed over her faculties; phantoms of law and duty
and religion sprang up, to clamor for their rights;
hastily she breathed an acquiescence, and then
spurned them away as phantoms, as disturbers of
the serenity of her soul. For the first time in all
her life she felt the thrill of passion; the sorcerer beheld
it, and closer and closer did he wind his web
around them both, until, convulsed by the mighty
battery within, he leaped from his seat, folded her
resistless form in her arms, imprinted one passionate
kiss upon her lips, and disappeared down the precipice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When she recovered a little self-possession, her
mind soon comprehended all; she felt and knew that
passion had taken possession of her, and that love
was gone; but never for a moment did she advert
to any fault of her own. If conscience arose, she
hastily repressed it, and despite what she inmostly
<span class='it'>felt</span>, declared in her own mind that she could not see,
measuring by laws of right and possession, wherein
she had transgressed. Then stepped in pride. She
transgressed! Oh! that one idea condemns the
cause. She, who never had sinned, even in thought,
against womanly decorum! yet, though her face
burned with indignation at the thought, it was her
own unerring conscience that accused, and against
which she turned in so virtuous a scorn. Poor Ella!
the great sin was already done. The loose rein she
had given to her ideas, had permitted the birth, the
growth, the <span class='it'>manifestation</span> of what she felt, consequently
the encouragement of Count Frederick’s
excited passion. What would strict principle have
done? Trembled, and crushed the serpent in the
egg. It had glided in and twined itself around her
bosom so gently and unconsciously that she scarcely
felt its presence; so brilliant and changing were its
deadly eyes in their repose, so yielding its soft and
graceful neck, that, trusting to its tameness, she
nursed its strength and venom there. At once she
felt a tightening of the coils. Who, but one willfully
deceived, would not have felt death! She did not;
she saw no death, but felt she could not cast her
visitant aside, felt that she might have to struggle
on and bear her burden triumphantly along. What
harm if no positive evil came of it? It was her own
burden; might she not bear it if she could? Thus
she beguiled her better reason; she did not reflect
that whosoever loveth danger shall perish in it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The reaction from the state of excitement she had
been in, was powerful, and she was just recovering
from it, when Roderick came and found her at the
bower, “pensive and melancholy,” as he termed it;
and, since they could not enjoy the evening together,
tenderly and affectionately led her home. This was
the first night of Roderick’s grief and Ella’s unhappiness.
One great effort would then have shaken
off her enemy forever, and restored the serenity of
her mind; but she did not see the necessity, the obligation;
it could be done at any time. Her pillow
was bedewed with her tears, but she attributed them
to the agitation of her feelings. All night, that one
moment of delirium was prolonged to hours in rapturous
dreams. She awoke weary and pale. She
was not responsible for her dreams, she reasoned;
probably she was not; but I would not answer for
the pleasure of them, for whenever her broken slumbers
were dispelled by consciousness, through the
night, she acknowledged the unlawfulness of dwelling
upon that pleasure then, and she courted sleep
as a means to enjoyment in irresponsibility. Her
harp lay untouched all day. Her daylight reveries
were but shadows of her midnight dreams; more
she did not dare. To her uncle’s somewhat anxious
inquiries she replied, that she had perspired so, all
night;—it was true. The next evening was quite
as charming as the preceding one. There was no
reason why she should not take her accustomed
stroll to the bower; it was her castle, as it were; she
had built it, and it was her almost daily haunt; she
saw no obligation to discontinue her visits there;
if any one came, it would be his intrusion, not hers.
Besides, if she did not meet Roderick there, he
would be hurt, and probably suspect her of growing
indifference. Step by step had she advanced so far
in blinding herself, as to be deceived by such a
transparency; in the days of her innocence it would
have shocked her. Her very duty to her betrothed
she converted into a pretext to betray him. Still,
call her not traitress. Like one who begins to believe
his oft-told lie to be the truth, a penalty for his
deceit, she more than half trusted her shallow sophistry.
No human power now, no stand of honor
or pride, can save her now; she has let the enemy
within the citadel to parley, and whilst she prates in
whispered, cowering tones, of future peace or victory,
he quietly possesses himself of every avenue and
stronghold, and nothing less than power divine can
lend the least effective aid. Will she ask it? Well
would she wish to do so, but the mighty effort of instantaneous
renunciation (the only condition for
God’s help) is too great; and with an ungrounded,
forlorn, despairing hope, she still thinks some impossibility
<span class='it'>may</span> come to pass, to save her soul. She
went earlier than usual, and long sat trembling in
her accustomed seat. When at last Count Frederick
appeared, she was not surprised; but an unaccountable
dread seized her, and she would have fled, had
he not gently detained her. She stopped; he saw
all at a glance, he knew every thought that was
agitating her mind; he understood her sudden impulse,
that it was a last effort of expiring virtue, and
he understood, too, that he possessed the power to
overrule it. He knew it was an issue of life or death,
and that either way, he held the hat in his hand.
Neither spoke. He stood, holding the unresisting
arm, gazed on her shrinking form, her imploring
eyes, her lips parted in sudden terror, upon her every
feature yielding in despair to the agony of a struggle
for her very soul; the loud beating of her heart
struck upon his ear with unearthly sound; he thought
of the affrighted lamb before the altar, felt that in
his hand gleamed the keen knife his beautiful victim
shrank from; his eyes drank in her exceeding loveliness,
his heart melted, and he burst into tears. He
sat upon the bench, half turned from her, his elbow
resting on the trellis, and his face buried in his handkerchief,
overcome by the storm of his feelings. At
this moment, the better nature in both, had a strong
game. There is something fearful to behold when
a strong man bends his head to tears. When a woman
weeps, it is the drops from a fleeting cloud, an
April shower, or, at times, the ceaseless pouring of
a settled rain—a deluge; but there is the flash, and
the storm, and the fitful blast that groans and yaws,
and bursts through all control. No woman can pass
on and not feel the cloak of her human sympathy
draw close around her, as if to impel her to go forth
and pour the unction of her tenderness upon the
troubled heart. And there Ella stood beside him;
one hand lay gently on his quivering shoulder, whilst
the other pushed back the scattered curls from his
noble brow. Oh, what a powerful language there
is in the human heart, without words! In all this
interview, since first they met, neither had spoken a
word. It was a pantomime in real life; yet, what
terrible converse they had held! Neither had ever,
in all their lives, spoken to the other one word of
love; and such a scene!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I intended,” said he, at length, as he pressed her
hand to his lips; “I intended to beg your forgiveness
for my extreme rudeness on yesterday. I was overcome,
beside myself; and now, when I would utter
the words of my supplication, they stick in my
throat. I am tossed like a leaf, before you; and
here I sit trembling like a child, beneath your touch.
I feel in my inmost heart the sweetness of your sympathy.
I go, and but for the treasure of that sweetness
my heart would wither in its desolation. I dare
not speak to you of love, for your troth is another’s.
At least, in mercy, vouchsafe to me one glimpse of
the Elysium denied me!” He folded her once more
to his heart; indistinctly she heard in spasmodic
whispers: <span class='it'>life—soul—dearest</span>—and he was gone.
The nobler nature was triumphant; and Ella, overcome
by his generosity and her now unquenchable
love, wept long and bitterly. She turned from side to
side in her loneliness, gazed into the heavens, upon the
wide landscape, until the tears blinded her. Then
she bent her head upon the trellis where he had
leaned; her dark hair hung in loose locks upon the
branching vines, and she moaned in very bitterness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That night she thought of Roderick, and for a moment
compared him with Count Frederick. What
a contrast! His very name, his only inheritance
from his forefathers, was essentially plebeian, rustic.
Ackerman! Roderick Ackerman, the husbandman!
She had never thought of that before! She, the
daughter of a noble house, could never bear that
name! Her dreams were not those of pleasure only,
for Roderick stood all night, a horrid phantom, between
her impatient love and its unlawful object.
Next morning she did not quiet her mind with the
reflection, that she was not responsible for her
dreams; and her midnight dreams, pleasure and displeasure,
were her daylight reveries.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Roderick’s society still possessed a singular charm
for her. In his presence she became more like her
former self. She still loved him with a calm, settled
love, which nothing on earth could ever destroy.
When he turned his mournful gaze toward her,
there was so much of tenderness and truth, so much
of ill-concealed anxiety and trust, that tears of anguish
and of pity would gather upon her eyelids, and
she would turn her head, to brush them away unseen.
There was no selfishness in her love for him;
it was virtuous and sincere, unshaken; yet, in his
absence her thoughts continually recurred to the all-absorbing
passion that possessed her. Day after day
would she go to the bower, but she found no pretext
now, in duty to Roderick, for she always returned
before it was time for him to be there, and he never
knew she went. He said to me on the mount, when
relating this portion of his history—“She never went
to the bower any more.” Count Frederick did not
come again. He secluded himself at home more
closely than ever—and let us not trespass upon the
sanctuary of a penitent heart. Poor Ella might have
been seen day after day, as evening drew near, wandering
alone over the hill, watching, with intense
anxiety, the path which Count Frederick would take
in case he <span class='it'>should</span> go out upon his evening walk.
A mournful, restless spirit of solitude she seemed,
ever wending her silent way among the evening
shadows, never venturing upon the sun-lit green.
At last her daring steps would turn toward the
manor, and she would take its circuit, on her way
to the bower. Once she passed, muffled and trembling,
through the very lawn. O! could she have
seen herself as others would have seen her, she
would have sunk into the earth for very shame.
How strange—that he who had been the ruthless
tempter, in heart and mind the fell destroyer, should
now, whilst retiring in virtuous seclusion, become
the tempted! How strange, how passing strange—that
she, poor victim, should become tempter, persecutor!
Yet so it was: and such is man.—And such
is woman—when she falls.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One day, from his chamber window he beheld her
retreating form slowly disappearing in a little copse
near the manor. The whole truth flashed like lightning
on his mind: that he was not the only tempter;
that not with him lay the damning guilt he had supposed;
that he was sought; that she could be gained.
The whirlwind of passion came again. The reflection
that he had too unjustly accused himself, stifled
every breath of remorse; and he went forth, in heart
a demon, worse than ever. He soon gained her, and
heaven-attesting vows were exchanged of never-dying
love. All that was honorable and fair for
man to do he promised. Their interviews thenceforward
were frequent and clandestine; her health
was failing in a perpetual struggle, and matters were
drawing to a crisis. She never told her uncle what
was done; she feared, she felt in her own heart,
that it was not honest love. Count Frederick, I
said, had promised all that was honorable for man to
do; that promise he did not intend to keep. The
more he thought over it, the more fully was he persuaded
that she was not sanguine of its observance.
After a lengthy consideration his plot was laid, and
he appointed a time with Ella for an interview at
the bower. It was Roderick’s eventful evening, the
one he alluded to when he said: “I could not resist
a moment’s visit to the bower, for, since pleasure
there seemed henceforth to be forbidden fruit to me,
I longed for a moment, even of its pain.” They
were both punctual to the appointment. Count
Frederick was paler than usual; she noticed his
agitation, and he, to cover it, took out his Virgil and
read her several beautiful passages. He turned to
the Æneiad, and wrought upon her mind and her
sympathies with the loves and sorrows, the struggles
and the fall, of the queenly Dido. She caught
the incendium, and as he repeated over and over,
with increasing gusto, the more inflammatory passages,
in the words of the poet, like Dido herself she
sat “<span class='it'>pendesque iterum narrantis ab ore</span>.” At
last, as he closed the book, he gazed intently on her,
trembling with the very burden of his task. He
took her hand; she smiled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ella,” said he, “dost thou love me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She took the book, and marked a passage with her
pencil. He read:</p>

</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The glow of her features attested the truth. He
continued:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wouldst thou be happy to wander the wide
world over by my side, to revel in the gayeties of
Paris, to stand amid the awful ruins of Athens and
Palmyra, to tread the hallowed spots of Palestine,
and bask in the sunny skies of Italy?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“With thee and honor, anywhere.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ella, thou hast a picture; let me see it? Who
gave it thee?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My mother.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When?—dost thou remember?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, when I was a tiny child. She gave it in
my hands and said it was all I had from my dear father
but his name.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thou hast his name. Dost thou know, Ella,
who this is?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I never knew.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know. I have seen her: she is living yet, and
bears but a slight resemblance now to this young
face.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell me of her; is she my father’s sister?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No; but wouldst thou know indeed?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Listen then—thy father’s wife.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She sat stupefied; her bosom heaved convulsively.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Couldst thou marry Roderick, now?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She started to her feet. “Fiend! I understand
you,” she shouted. Her eyes flashed, her form dilated,
her outstretched arm quivered with the
strength of her indignation; whilst her melodious
voice raised in tones of inspiration, rang through the
evening stillness with the poet’s terrible imprecation:</p>

<p class='noindent'>And she fell lifeless upon the ground. A step was
heard. The count launched himself down the precipice.
Roderick came, saw, and flew off on the
wings of the wind, with a crushed heart and raving
brain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ella’s first act of returning consciousness was to
recognize herself reclining in the arms of Count
Frederick. The swaying to and fro, the heavy
lurch, the crackling stones, the dashing tramp, soon
brought home to her mind the terrible certainty that
she had departed from Heidelberg forever. How
far she was away, whither she was going she knew
not: she only knew that she was lost beyond redemption.
Her body and her mind were powerless, paralyzed
in utter imbecility: she could not, would not
will: but as the reality of the world and her existence
in it stole on her awakening senses, every power of
her soul rushed to the view of her prostration; her
heart struggled in very anguish, her reason staggered
from side to side in the mazes of a darksome labyrinth;
night had gathered around, and heavy dews
swept through the carriage windows; terrors, strange
and indefinable, fell like a death chill on her sickened
soul, and she clung with frenzied grasp to the form
beside her. Words of love, of courage, of hope,
breathed into her ears another life, and she abandoned
her whole being to the power of its inspiration.
Ere morning dawned they were far away, and
the second nightfall beheld them in Cologne.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Before I proceed any further, let me make a little
necessary explanation concerning Ella’s picture.
What Count Frederick said concerning her “father’s
wife,” he knew to be utterly false. The miniature
was that of a lady Mr. Corbyn had been affianced to
in England, and whom he forsook for another, more
to his liking. As the engagement had become notorious,
and he felt the extent of the injury he was indicting
upon her and her family, he retired into as
great obscurity as possible, on the continent, and
married Katrina. Ere many years he was discovered
in his retreat, and the arrival of the strangers in
his village, his fall in a duel with a brother of his
former betrothed, were consequent upon that discovery.
Ella’s birth was honorable as birth could
be. The mystery which hung about the picture had
prepared her mind to become the easy dupe of a well-told
lie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Many days Ella lay consuming beneath the fire of
a raging fever, whilst a sad and anxious watcher,
night and day, moved ever silently about the darkened
chamber. This was the most trying period of
Count Frederick’s life. Ever and anon the low murmuring
of troubled dreams would fall like heavy
curses on his cowering heart; and as he would gently
move aside the curtains and bend his ear to feel the
parching breath, words fraught with the odor of
youthful innocence would ascend. Now the light
of childhood’s golden hours would beam softly on
her mind, and smiles of love and tenderness and purity
would gently play about her mouth, dimpling her
beautiful features with holy pleasure as she would
whisper: “Yes, dear mother, Ella knows, listen—‘God
keep little Ella from all sin.’ ” Then there would
be some uneasy motion, some momentary contortion,
as from a sudden pang, and then a low, trembling
sigh, scarce rising with its burden of despair. O,
how he shook in very agony! Then all was still.
Her degradation, though she was unconscious of its
existence, seemed, like an unknown and unfelt medicinal
application, to extend, by some inappreciable virtue
of its own, its subtle influence unceasingly through
the system. Soon, names most familiar in her joyous
girlhood, brief snatches of song or hymn that none
but ecstatic moods of happiness or devotion ever
called forth from her stores of melody; even the
name of Roderick, accompanied with a tender relaxation
and softened whisper, rose up like threatening
spectres in Count Frederick’s night of mental darkness.
He gazed and gazed on her pallid loveliness,
watched every quiver of her parted lips, and could
have rejoiced in the life of their occasional smile or
tranquillity; but, that the hidden, lightless eyes, and
the ever “chill, changeless brow”—for it never
changed in all her emotions—appalled with the coldness
of some fearful death: and he turned away. He
would have prayed, if he could, for that poor being,
but his heart was void; it was his brain that ached,
for he knew that all that melancholy ruins had
fallen from a sublime structure by his fell utterance
of a lie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It behooves me now to hasten this lengthy history
to a close. As soon as possible our wanderers hastened
off to Paris, to restore their sunken spirits amid
the pleasures and gayeties of the <span class='it'>beau monde</span>. There
it was I saw them, as they took their evening airing
along the Champs Elysées. They had been there
several months, and poor Ella’s looks and manner
both told the inefficiency of worldly pleasure, to
lighten the heavy burden of a guilty soul. The gayety
of France was like the smart of sparkling wine on an
ulcerated sore, and away they wandered into distant
lands. The still, death-like aspect of the Grecian
shores seemed like the languor of cold sympathy
with her own silent sorrow; and as the startling
semblance rose up before her, and she viewed in
every phase and feature that all that was elevating
and life-giving was passed away, she shuddered at
her own kindred desolation. She would venture
upon the rocky cliffs and gaze into the troubled sea,
where—as now in her own mind—the lights of Heaven
were pictured in flitting and uncertain forms;
she would look abroad upon the unspotted blue,
where not a coming or departing sail broke the distinct
horizon, and she would reflect how the powers
of her soul were mouldered away, and brought no
more back to her enjoyment the riches and the fruits
of other climes, the luxuries from nature’s and religion’s
overflowing bounty. Then she would wander
upon the lonely strand, and the splashing of the
journeyed waters, whose tempest roar was spent in
low, last murmurs at her feet, reëchoed the wild
moanings of a dying spirit. Oh! how she sat and
cried. Had her tears been those of repentance and
return, they would have hallowed for ever a spot that
was only classic, and her groans would have lifted
the vault of Heaven; but the bitter drops, wrung by
degradation and despair, were swept away by the
encroaching wavelets—and the sighs were borne afar
by the winds, to swell that everlasting <span class='it'>ROMOR</span> of anguish
that never reaches God.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the Roman Colosseum, the blood-stained arena
of the martyrs seemed to burn her very feet, and she
looked not upon a stone, nor an herb, in that sanctuary
of Christendom but returned a look of withering
reproach, as if by express command of Heaven.
There was no peace. Like Jonah, had she tried to
flee from the wrath of God, and find ease and security
in sin; and now that she found it not, she longed
for death—but dared not court it—as the oblivion of
all her being.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again our fugitives sought the resources of Paris.
Ella was fast failing in health, and both knew that
she must soon die. She possessed no longer any
gayety, and Count Frederick secretly rejoiced in
her decline, as the only means of ridding himself of
a burden now become almost insupportable. Still,
her death would not have occurred without inflicting
upon him one severe pang; for her intellect, increasing
in beauty and brilliancy as the body faded,
held him in a spell that seemed to involve his very
life. A short time after their arrival in Paris, the
revolution of February put all Europe in a commotion.
It was a God-send to Count Frederick, for a
field now opened to him for the employment of his
faculties; something at last, if not repose, at least a
breathing spell to ease him in his tired struggle with
a sleepless, unflagging remorse. He plunged into the
under-revolutionary current, heedless of whence it
flowed or where it came to light. All manner of
impure ultraïsm gathering in its way, formed the
nuclei of innumerable vortices that eddied and
whirled at every turn of his onward progress, hurling
him along with strange fits of semi-delirium,
until the following June, when the whole concentrated
power bubbled in red volumes to the surface,
and the streets of Paris ran with human blood.
Count Frederick became a willing tool in crafty
hands, and shrank not from offices of most imminent
danger. All night and all day did he lend his wealth,
his influence and his labor to the construction of
barricades for the defense of the populace: he became
a leading spirit, and on several occasions his
sword was foremost in the fray. His attire, his
repose, his ordinary food, all was forgotten. Once
he stood tired and worn, within a new barricade
not far from the barrière St. Martin; his hat and coat
were thrown aside, his dress all torn and begrimed
with sweat and dirt; in one hand he held a naked
sword, whilst the other grasped the stock of a pistol
that was still unmoved from his leathern belt. Upon
this arm hung poor Ella, still clinging through toil
and danger to him she could not but love. Her
bonnet was thrown aside; a soiled cambric handkerchief
tied beneath the chin, had kept in check
her unbound hair, but it was now in places loose
and disheveled; one dark lock swung around her
neck, and as it reposed upon her bosom, the curled,
purple extremity appeared in fearful contrast with
the snowy field it lay upon. Woman to the last,
she bore upon her person many a mark of blood,
and many dying lips within the last few hours, had
breathed a blessing upon the unknown and beautiful
angel of mercy that bent above them. Upon a stove,
that had been carried into the middle of the street,
stood a popular demagogue, gesticulating wildly,
and thundering anathemas against the provisional
government, that were horrible for ears to listen to;
whilst around him stood some hundreds of the armed
and excited populace, venting, at almost every gesture
of the frantic orator, vows of eternal vengeance
on what they deemed the recreant soldiery. Some
one had just arrived to announce that the military,
in force, were marching upon them. The shadow
of the hand of death seemed already to rest upon the
multitude, and not an eye was there that did not
dwell upon eternity. Soon the military, in serried
ranks and with bristling bayonets, wheeled into
view far down the street, and then commenced the
steady advance upon the barricade. The orator
grew wilder and wilder, and every heart in that vast
multitude quivered in awful expectation. The street
was cleared, not a soul moved upon the side-walks;
and the measured tread of the soldiers, with now
and then a groan or shriek from out some chamber,
was all that broke the silence as they marched along.
Soon the note of death sounded in the rear, then the
noise of changing muskets, at the word of command—and
immediately was heard from out the barricade,
trembling in solemn melody, low sounds as of
some unearthly dirge; and the words, “<span class='it'>Mourir pour
la patrie</span>”—arose with many a mingled yell. With
the gallop of the words—“<span class='it'>c’est la mort la plus
belle</span>,” all rushed to action, and when the first great
burst of the murderous fire was past, the last words
of the death-song still rang o’er piles of bleeding
men.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The attack on this barricade was long and bloody.
At the second discharge, Count Frederick rolled
from the mound of curb-stones upon which he had
leaped to replace a fallen red-republican ensign, and
was borne into a neighboring house; there all assistance
ceased. As he lay bleeding upon the floor, in
a state of almost insensibility, Ella knelt beside him,
striving to staunch with her handkerchief, her dress,
her hair, the exhaustless spring of blood that welled
up from a bullet wound in his chest. Not a word
escaped her lips, not a tear fell from her eye, but
she bent all the faculties of her mind to the faithful
accomplishment of her stupendous task. His breathing
became weak and weaker; she heeded it not.
The veil of eternity was settling upon him, and the
dim vision of mortality was being illumined under
its shadow; the heinousness of his damning crime
shone out in perfect distinctness; but one reparation,
he thought, and that a slight one, remained; but
how could he ever summon courage to speak it
there? She seemed to him, in truth, an angel, as he
turned his glazing eyes toward her; she would not
yield to despair. He made the sacrifice; collected
all his strength of body and of mind, and told to the
wretched girl the story of his deception. It fell
upon her like a thunderbolt. For the first time she
became aware of the stupendous depth of her fall.
Her only stay, her only consolation, her only anchor
of future hope, upon her troubled sea, had rested on
the excuse of natal degradation: now that was taken
away. She sunk upon the floor; but in a moment,
with frantic energy she bounded to her feet, and
seizing the flag-staff from the dying hand, rushed into
the street. The combat still raged; leaping over the
dead and dying, with a bound she reached the breast-work.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The French journals, in describing the assault
upon, and the carrying of this barricade, illustrated
the enthusiastic patriotism of the insurgents, with
the story of a young and beautiful girl, who, in the
hottest of the fight, leaped upon the ramparts, flag in
hand, and waving it gallantly above her head, shouting—<span class='it'>liberté</span>—fell,
pierced by a hundred bullets, outside
the barricade. It was Ella Corbyn.</p>

<div><h1><a id='don'></a>A REPLY TO DWIGHT’S ARTICLE ON MOZART’S DON GIOVANNI.</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>This is the title of a long and prominent article in
Graham’s February number: the writer is but a
wordy plagiarist. He has received many rebukes
already for his cool appropriation of the ideas of
others, but Aristabulus Bragg fashion, he still goes
on, in the calmest, most approved style, perfectly
unblushing. A year or eighteen months ago an article
of his in Sartain’s Magazine was pointed out to
us as containing some clever thoughts on a very
original idea, “the Musical Trinity.” Oh, we exclaimed,
this is not original, the whole idea is stolen
from the German; then we turned to Goethe’s correspondence
with a child, Bettina von Arnheim, and
found several passages on the same subject in conversations
with Beethoven and Schlosser. Some time
after we read in <a id='sar'></a>Saroni’s Musical Times that the
editor had also detected the plagiarism in this article,
and pointed out another author, book and page; saying
with great good-nature that he would not have
noticed it, had Mr. Dwight only written his article
as clearly and concisely as the original; “but to rob
an author first and then murder him,” says the editor,
“is more than we can bear.” The author alluded
to by Mr. Saroni, is the German Marx, and he tells
us that the fourth paragraph in Sartain’s article
is an almost literal translation of a paragraph in
Marx’s “<span class='it'>Komposition-shlere</span>,” second edition, p. 24.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We have waded through this last article of Mr.
Dwight’s on Don Giovanni, partly from curiosity,
partly for amusement. We wanted to see the extent
to which he would go: and then it amused us
to detect the little pilfered thoughts, trigged out in
the Boston transcendental clothing until their parents
would have scarcely recognized them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It opens with quite a flourish, trying to decorate
the story and hero as the German Hoffman did long
ago, but though the whole of the first part is a spun-out
translation of the German critic’s description, it
is so mingled with his own crude, half-educated
thoughts, as to require some little skill in separating
Hoffman from Dwight. He has made an attempt
to improve upon the German, and we can not say
we admire the Boston imitation. Judge for yourself
by the following comparison:</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>DWIGHT.</h2>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>The true conception of
Mozart’s Don Giovanni is
that of a gentleman, to say
the least, and more than
that, a man of genius: a being
naturally full of glorious
passion, large sympathies
and irrepressible energies,
noble in mind, in person and
in fortune; a large, imposing,
generous, fascinating
creature. He is such as we
all are—“<span class='it'>only more so</span>,” to
borrow an expressive vulgarism.
He is a sort of
ideal impersonation of two
qualities or springs of character,
raised as it were to
the highest power projected
into supernatural dimensions—which
is only the
poet’s and musician’s way
of truly recognizing the
element of infinity in every
passion of the human soul,
since not one ever finds its
perfect satisfaction.</p>

</div>

<h2 class='nobreak'>HOFFMAN.</h2>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>Nature had provided for
Don Giovanni, one of her
dearest children, all that
could elevate a man above
the crowd which is condemned
to be, to do, and to
suffer: she had lavished on
him the gifts which bid the
human nature approximate
to the divine. She had destined
him to shine, to conquer
and to rule. She had
animated with a splendid
organization that vigorous
and accomplished frame:
had inspired that breast
with a celestial spark: had
given to him a soul of deep
feeling, quick and penetrating
intelligence.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>We think Hoffman’s description of Don Giovanni
a little exaggerated, but the Boston imitation is what
may be called a “free translation,” <span class='it'>very</span> free. All that
duality business—“<span class='it'>that ideal impersonation of two
qualities or springs of character</span>,” is decidedly an attempt
to amplify, if not to improve the German criticism,
and is in the usual moral-defying style of the no-principle
school of Harbinger and Phalanx writers. In
olden times our grand-parents, when they saw any
thing particularly broad or free in expression or action,
were apt to say, with a proper shrug of the
shoulders, that it was “<span class='it'>very French</span>.” At the present
day, when we see any thing questionable in
morals or opinions we exclaim, “<span class='it'>transcendental,
mock German</span>, and, <span class='it'>very Boston;</span>” and thus we say
of this attempt of Mr. Dwight’s to idealize the very
sensual, commonplace libertine of the opera.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We will now give another comparison.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>DWIGHT.</h2>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>Excessive love of pleasure,
helped by a rare magnetism
of character, and
provoked by the suppressive
moralism of the times,
have engendered in him a
reckless, roving, unsatiable
appetite, which intrigue
excites and disappoints until
<span class='it'>the very passion in which
so many souls are first
taught the feeling of the infinite</span>
becomes a fiend in his
breast, and drives him to a
devilish love of power that
exults over woman’s ruin,
or rather, that does not
mind how many hearts and
homes fall victims to his
unqualified assertion of the
every where rejected and
snubbed faith in Passion.</p>

</div>

<h2 class='nobreak'>HOFFMAN.</h2>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>In truth, there is nothing
on earth which more elevates
a man in his own
opinion than love, that love
whose vast and conquering
influence gives light to the
heart, and gives it at once
happiness and confusion.
Can we be surprised if,
when Don Juan hoped to
appease by love the passions
which rent his breast,
that the devil spread a net
for him? It was he who
inspired Don Juan with the
thought that by love and
the society of woman we
may accomplish on earth
<span class='it'>those celestial promises
which we bear written in
the deepest recesses of our
hearts, that intense desire
which from our earliest
days brings us most closely
to heaven</span>.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The principal difference Mr. Dwight makes in his
rendering of this passage of Hoffman’s is, that where
the German, in a very old-fashioned manner, attributes
Don Juan’s wickedness to the influence of the
Spirit of Evil, Mr. Dwight, by some slight of hand,
metamorphoses the Passion of Love into an evil
demon, and then gives a <span class='it'>fling</span>, as he would express
it, at the religious discipline of the times to
which he applies the very lucid epithet, “<span class='it'>suppressive
moralism</span>.” We wish we had some of that
“<span class='it'>suppressive moralism</span>” at the present day to exercise
a little wholesome discipline over the authors
of this</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'><span class='it'>Phalanx Socialist Literature</span>.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>After this piece of borrowing and altering from
Hoffman, the writer talks a great deal about “<span class='it'>the
old theme and under-current of Opera—the Body
and the Soul—the liberty of Passion in conflict
with the Law intensely narrowed down by social
custom from God’s great law of universal harmony</span>,”
and such like rubbish, and then informs us
in a note, with his usual precision, by way of illustrating
this “<span class='it'>under-current</span>” of “<span class='it'>Body and Soul</span>”
in “<span class='it'>Old Opera theme</span>,” that, strange to say, the first
Opera <span class='it'>he</span> reads of, and which was produced at Rome
in 1600, bore the name of “<span class='it'>Rappresentatione <a id='del'></a>di
Anima e di Corpo!</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now if this were so, it is puzzling to know what
it would have to do with all his talk about “<span class='it'>the
under-current of Body and Soul</span>” in Don Giovanni:
but it is not true. The first Opera on record is
<span class='it'>Euridice</span>, the libretto composed by the poet Rinuccini,
the music by the composer Peri. It was presented,
as he says, in 1600, but not at Rome—at
Florence, on the occasion of the marriage of Mary
di Medici with Henri Quatre of France.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In 1600, Emilio del <a id='cav1'></a>Cavalieri, of Rome, brought
out an <span class='it'>Oratorio</span>, which was sung in a church in that
city, which bore the title <a id='anima'></a>“<span class='it'>Dell Anima e di Corpo</span>;”
and the invention of <span class='it'>Recitative</span> dates from these
two compositions—the opera <span class='it'>Euridice</span> of Peri, and
the <span class='it'>Sacred Oratorio</span> of <a id='cav2'></a>Cavalieri. But it answered
his purpose to imagine this the other way, and with
his usual want of accuracy he applied it—or he was
ignorant, and with true transcendental presumption,
took it for granted no one knew any more than he
did.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Such reviews as this we now write of would be
scarcely worth noticing, if it were not for the fact,
that they are accepted by the uninstructed, for real
<span class='it'>bona fide</span> musical criticisms, founded on actual
knowledge. One might have expected that Mr.
Saroni’s rebuking exposure of his Musical Trinity
Article, would have startled the author into something
like modesty; and when one sees how reckless
he is, it makes one wish that Mr. Saroni would
carry his threat into execution, and publish those
“certain articles” on Mozart’s Don Giovanni, which
bear such a remarkable similarity to Mr. Dwight’s
lectures.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. Bombert says, in his “Life of Mozart,” when
speaking of this Opera of Don Giovanni—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He (Mozart) shines in the awful accompaniment
to the reply of the statue—a composition perfectly
free from all inflation or bombast—it is <span class='it'>the style of
Shakspeare in music</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now for Mr. Dwight’s patch-work—straightway
he snatches up this idea of M. Bombert, and makes
use of it thus:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The splendid sinner’s end is rather melo-dramatic
in the Opera, and yet there is a poetic and moral
truth in it—and <span class='it'>the spectre of the commendatore is a
creation fully up to Shakspeare</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This is literary murder as well as literary theft.
Now any one who knows any thing of this Opera
will see that the “<span class='it'>creation of the commendatore</span>”
has nothing remarkable in it, but the <span class='it'>Orchestral Accompaniment</span>
is one of the grandest things ever composed.
Mozart cared very little for the stage part
of the affair; and this is proved by the finest music
in this Opera being given to the Orchestra. We
have heard—we cannot give the authority—but we
have read somewhere, that a contemporary critic
said that Mozart had put his statue in the Orchestra,
and left only the pedestal on the stage—and this is
true.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Dwight gives such an exaggerated, spun-out
account of this famous Opera, endeavoring at the
same time to gloss over the gross, vulgar, immorality
of the plot, with all that confused mysticism
peculiar to this Harbinger and Phalanx style of composition,
that we will sketch a short matter-of-fact
outline of it. Mr. Dwight, with the usual insane
transcendental desire to apply an epithet, and make
a speech, says, in a short sentence, which he thinks
very comprehensive, that it “<span class='it'>is an old middle age
Catholic story</span>;” making a sort of defense for the
shocking immoralities in it, by accusing, impliedly,
the strict discipline of the church for the libertine
hero’s licentiousness, to whom he applies another
string of expletives. In the opening, Mr. Dwight
calls him “<span class='it'>a large, imposing, generous, fascinating
creature</span>.” Now he has him “<span class='it'>an elegant, full-blooded,
rich, accomplished, and seductive gallant</span>.”
A sort of “<span class='it'>a love of a man</span>” according to
Mr. Dwight’s ideas.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The subject of the story of Don Giovanni was a
favorite one in the 17th century—“<span class='it'>the middle age
Catholic times!</span>” Mr. Dwight talks of, in his off-hand
sentence characterizing the story, was a little
earlier than that, we think, a trifle of two or three
hundred years or so—but let that pass. French,
Italian, and Spanish writers all used it. Moliere
wrote a famous play on it, “<span class='it'>Festin de Pierre</span>,” and
from Moliere’s play Da Ponte prepared his libretto.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The story is a decided failure; and a great deal
of time, and paper, and manufactured sentiment have
been wasted in endeavoring to excuse and even to
discover hidden philosophy and a good moral in it.
Mr. Dwight is not the first one at this piece of business.
If the wish is to make operatic music elevate
and refine the public taste, by contributing to the
moral purity of our people, composers should not
select immoral and wicked plots; and no matter
how beautiful the music may be, no audience should
tolerate such a degrading story as Don Giovanni.
It is full of all sorts of unnatural and disgusting scenes.
The opening is very fine, and leads one to expect
something tragic and grand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Don Giovanni, a wicked, reckless libertine, has
entered at midnight the house of an old military
officer, and is seen at the rising of the curtain rushing
out of the door, followed by the beautiful daughter
of the commander, who he had intended to add to
the list of his victims. A beautiful, rapid duet ensues
between this daughter, Donna Anna, and Don Giovanni,
she endeavoring to discover the bold ravisher.
During this, her old father comes out, sword in hand—a
combat ensues—Don Giovanni kills the old officer,
and escapes. Then follows a beautiful <span class='it'>scena</span>, one
of the gems of the Opera, between Donna Anna and
her lover, Ottavio. She expresses her grief in heart-rending
notes, and with frantic earnestness calls on
her lover to avenge the murder. All this promises
well, and one would imagine from so grand a commencement,
something magnificently tragic was
surely to follow. But the whole of the middle part
of the Opera is flat and insipid—we are speaking
now only of the story—filled with disgusting scenes
of Don Giovanni’s gallantries. With a hard and
sensual heart, he betrays alike the high and the low—the
lady and the maid; he stains the palace and
pollutes the peasant’s cot with his wanton treachery
and crimes. He goes to a village festival, and selects
for another victim, a poor village girl, a bride—Zerlina.
This character was one of Madam Malibran’s
famous parts, as Donna Anna was of Sontag’s.
Zerlina, though properly the second Donna’s character,
occupies more room in the Opera than the
first soprano, Donna Anna. The famous duet, “<span class='it'>La
ci darem la mano</span>,” is sung by Don Giovanni and
her; and her little <span class='it'>coquetries</span> with the libertine lord,
and seductive coaxing scenes with her peasant
bridegroom, occupy a large portion of the middle
part of the Opera.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A Donna Elvira, a discarded wife or mistress it
seems to matter little which—of Don Giovanni comes
in also. A trying scene ensues between her and Leperello—the
impudent, buffoon valet of Don Giovanni—the
<span class='it'>buffo</span> character of the opera, during which, he
tells her of his master’s conquests, while the poor
Elvira has to stand mute, and listen to his long,
comic piece; which—if she is not a better actress
than is generally cast in a third-rate character—makes
it very absurd in representation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After the grand opening scene of the first Act,
Donna Anna and her lover Ottavio dwindle down into
insignificance. All their frantic declarations of revenge
end in nothing, and they content themselves
with following the licentious nobleman about in
masquerade; once in a while picking him up in the
streets, unmasking, and entertaining themselves in
berating him. They sing a beautiful trio with Elvira,
just before the banquet scene; which is about
the only good and useful thing they do in the Opera.
For it serves a double purpose—as an English critic
suggests—besides pleasing the audience, it gives
time to have the stage prepared for the banquet-scene.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Don Giovanni, after flirting with and seducing fine
ladies and humble peasant maidens, at last meets
with his punishment; but not at the hands of the injured
fair ones, or at the more probable ones of the
outraged lovers; that would be too reasonable for
this most unnatural story, but the grave must yield
up its dead, and the infernal regions disclose their
horrible secrets. At midnight, again he enters upon
the stage—the scene represents a square, containing
a marble monument, erected by Donna Anna to the
memory of her murdered father. Leporello is with
him, frightened to death at the sight of the grave by
moonlight, and he declares to his reckless master
that the statue moves its head. The bold libertine
scoffs at the valet’s cowardice, and by way of bravado,
invites the marble statue to sup with him.
To his amazement the Statue answers “Yes,” “<span class='it'>Si</span>,”
and here is that beautiful passage in the <span class='it'>music</span> which
M. Bombert considers the Shakspearian style in music—it
is the <span class='it'>Orchestral Accompaniment</span> to the
simple <span class='it'>reply</span> of the Statue. A little startled, Don
Giovanni leaves the stage. But in the next scene he
appears as abandoned as ever. What a capital transcendental
critic he would have made. He is supping
alone, and seems to eat with great <span class='it'>goût</span>. During
his solitary banquet the Statue enters, according to
the engagement. Don Giovanni can scarcely credit
his senses; but, bold to the last, receives his remarkable
guest with great ceremony. The Statue tells
him he has come on a mission of warning, and that
he has yet a chance for repentance. Don Giovanni
scoffs at the offer, and overcoming his awe, takes the
extended hand of the Statue. In an instant, he is
struck with the death-pangs—the Statue disappears—and
he dies in a vision of endless torments, which
is generally represented on the stage by a display of
fireworks, giving the vulgar idea of the infernal regions;
a place made for the devil and his angels.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now it is this shameless, coarse libertine that Mr.
Dwight in his article, following in the wake of others,
strives not only to excuse, but to idealize and elevate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We have done with the story: let us return for a
few moments to Mozart’s part of this Opera—the
music. Off of the stage, in a <span class='it'>salon</span> or concert-room,
the effect of this Opera is most beautiful; for on the
stage the immoral, vulgar story, low buffoonery and
farce-like appearance of many of the scenes, are
sadly at variance with the elevated and almost religious
tone of the music, and disgust even a hearty
admirer, if he is candid enough to admit it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Let us here take leave of this subject and of Mr.
Dwight: begging of him in future, if he is not able
to be original, to at least copy good models of style
and morals, and not inflict upon the community his
own exaggerated, loose-principled, Boston notions.
Luckily, however, his style is so confused and mystified,
that much of the injurious effect is lost. We
have heard these Boston non-religionists talk, and
we know with what <span class='it'>goût</span> they “<span class='it'>defy the moral</span>” of
any matter, to use Mr. Dwight’s own words; then,
how can one expect better principles, where such
laxity of morals are avowed. The closing sentence
in this Don Giovanni article is a pretty fair specimen
of this anti-religious, moral-defying kind of literature;
indeed, the whole article is—for “<span class='it'>passion life</span>,”
“<span class='it'>innate gospel of joy</span>,” and such English run-mad
expressions dance through the whole article, enlivened
and varied, once in a while, with some of
the fire-engine vernacular.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Shame! shame upon such literature! Mr. Dwight
talks of the “<span class='it'>divine good of the senses and the passions</span>,”
and longs for that “<span class='it'>pure and perfect state</span>,”
when these grosser parts of our nature “<span class='it'>shall be—not
dreaded, not suppressed; but regulated, harmonized,
made rythmical and safe, and more than
ever lifesome and spontaneous, by Law as broad
and as deep themselves</span>.” A pretty state of affairs
we should have in such a hereafter as these
people long for. All this is entirely foreign to our
old-fashioned notions of Heaven and a hereafter. It
may be the Heaven of an Agapedome, or a Woman’s
Rights Convention, but it is not the Heaven of a
Christian. And they will find out, sooner or later,
that there is a real hereafter—a solemn, and stern
judging hereafter; and though they may imagine
that their transcendental “<span class='it'>Souls, with their capacity
for joy and harmony, is of that godlike and asbestos
quality</span>,” as to defy punishment, punishment
will come, and pretty effectual it will be, and they
will see all this “spiritual asbestos quality”—why not
<span class='it'>gutta percha</span>, just as well—of little account, when
they are found with lamps untrimmed, and talents
buried in the earth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the year 1810, a native of Philadelphia resided
in the city of Altona, and became intimately
acquainted with Gen. McC——, who commanded
the Irish patriots at the battle of Ballanahench.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The general was a real Irish gentleman, with a
heart alive to every refined sympathy of human nature,
and warmly attached to Americans and the
American character. Never can it be forgotten by
those who were so happy as to share his confidence,
how his fine manly countenance would light up, as
he listened to the answers his questions would draw
forth, when inquiring into the private characters of
any of our revolutionary sages or soldiers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Often would the tears start into his eyes, when,
at the social bowl, some unpublished anecdote would
be elicited of the daring of Putnam, the Hannibal-like
qualities of Greene and Marion, the persevering
bravery of Rifle Morgan, or the daring of General
Wayne in his battles with the savage foe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His whole soul would appear to flash from his
expressive eye, and he would burst forth with the
exclamation: “Oh, Erin, oh my beloved country,
from which, alas! I am banished, when will heroes
such as these arise and burst the bands by which
thou art enslaved?—Will a just God never hear
thy prayers? Will the groans of enslaved millions,
will the agonies of a brave and generous people never
reach thy throne, and call down thy vengeance upon
her persecutors? Excuse me,” he would say, “excuse
the companion of the Emmets, the McNevens,
and others, who were confined with me in Fort
George, in Scotland, from whence I was transported
hither—banished! What a word! banished from
the home of my childhood—torn from the land where
my forefathers dwelt!” On one occasion of this kind,
when the most of the company had retired, in his
own hospitable mansion, he invited his Philadelphia
friend to remain and hear the sad story of his life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He rose from the table, and going to a book-case,
he produced a copy of Campbell’s poems, and turning
to the beautiful song of Erin-go-bragh—“there,”
said he, “is my history, I am the original Erin-go-bragh.
My countrymen, I am told, often inquire
how it happened that a Scotchman should write this
national, this glowing account of the wrongs of my
devoted countrymen. Listen to me, and I will truly
tell you the whole story—that is, if I can tell it! If
I can sufficiently compose myself, you shall hear it;
and should you survive me <span class='it'>you</span> may publish it, that
the mystery may be solved and the world may know
how the heart of a Scotch poet was touched with
the holy sympathy of our common nature, and has
placed on record, in the most exalted and touching
numbers, the feelings of an Irish exile. While confined
in the fortress of Fort George I was, without
any knowledge of what was to be my fate, conveyed
to a seaport and put on board of an English frigate,
to be banished I knew not whither!” (The name
of the port of embarkation and of the vessel were
given, but are not now remembered.) “On board
of this vessel was Campbell, the Scotch poet, then
about to make his pedestrian tour on the continent
of Europe. It was not long before we became intimately
acquainted, and as you may suppose my
whole heart was filled with wo.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“During our passage to this place, we had many
and very close conversations, pending which I
poured into his attentive ear, in impassioned language,
the sad—the overwhelming woes of my
countrymen, and particularly my own hard fate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We were not very long in reaching our destination—we
landed together at Altona, and what was
my surprise to find my companion as destitute of
money as myself. I had been hurried away without
the knowledge of my friends, who had no intimation
of my banishment, and coming from close confinement,
was not overburdened with a wardrobe, much
less with the necessary funds for decency, to say
nothing of comfort.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Campbell was as poor as myself, and in this
condition we entered a very common inn, and were
ushered into a room, not very well furnished, having
nothing but an oaken table and a very few common
chairs. We seated ourselves at opposite sides of
the table, and gazed at each other with no enviable
feelings, when, on examining our exchequer, we
found the whole sum in the treasury amounted to
no more than a crown. We called for a candle, for
it was growing dark, and ordered, in consonance
with our finances, a small bottle of rum. The light
came, and you must believe me when I tell you it
was a dip candle stuck in a black bottle. There
was something so ludicrous in this, and in our general
circumstances, that we both indulged in a hearty
laugh, applying ourselves to the ‘Cruise Keen Lawn’
to keep up for a time the tone of our feelings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As our spirits were operated upon by the
wretched liquor, which we drank more to drown
the rising sigh than for any partiality for it, Campbell
called for pen, ink, and paper. ‘Mr. McC.’ said he,
‘your story has deeply interested me, and a kind of
notion has arisen that I should like to put it upon
paper.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In a little time a miserable ink-horn was produced,
and something which was called paper, but
it was so stained, and otherwise disfigured, it seemed
almost impossible, with the wretched pen that accompanied
it, that legible characters could be traced
upon it; and I could but indulge in my risible propensities,
at the idea of any attempt to write with
such materials.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But the soul of the poet had been aroused, and
he bade me again to refresh his memory with my
tale, which I did by replying to such questions as he
from time to time propounded to me. Every now
and then he would pause, and pledge me in the tin
cup with which we were furnished, for glasses there
were none; when he would again commence to
write, and before he had finished, so potent were the
draughts in which we had indulged, that some of the
last lines ran in any other direction than parallel to
each other.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At last he finished his labors, and the result of
them was the song of Erin-go-bragh, the very song
printed in his works, and which I now hand to you.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is a true history of that inimitable production,
more full of feeling, in my opinion, than any
thing he has ever written before or since.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Read it to me,” said the general, “for if the
king would withdraw the act which banished me,
the object nearest my Irish heart, I could not read
that song aloud!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Such was the story told to the writer, as nearly as
it can be remembered, after a lapse of thirty-eight
years. There are yet living in this city several persons
who will recognize it, and an appeal to them
for the accuracy with which it is here told, would
confirm it in every particular; its only defect being
the absence of power in the writer to impart to his
readers any thing of the enthusiasm with which
General McC. related it—nor the heart-stirring emotion
ever exhibited by him when it became, as it
often did, the subject of conversation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the reader may feel desirous to know what
was subsequently the fate of the real and original
Erin-go-bragh, he may be told that his friends found
out where he was, remitted him funds, that he embarked
in a profitable pursuit, and ever after lived in
comparative affluence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The story of his marriage is of so romantic a nature,
that as he is now no more, and there is therefore
no impropriety in giving it publicity, the writer
is tempted to narrate it, as he has often listened to it
from the lips of the general, at his own hospitable
board, in the presence of his wife.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘There she is,’ he would say, ‘she is my preserver!’
Campbell and myself continued in our
lodgings, and with Saturday night came the bill of
expenses, but alas! our means were exhausted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When the bill for the first week was presented
to us, ‘Well,’ said the poet to me, ‘what do you
propose to do, general?’ To which I replied, ‘Do!—what
do I propose to do, did you ask me? I might
put the same question to you—but no! let an Irishman
alone for getting out of a scrape. I will call
up the landlord, and tell him our story; adding, that
I expect ere long my relatives will find out whither
I have been sent, and it cannot be, but that in a short
time funds will be sent to me.’ Suiting the action to
the word, I rang the bell, the landlord appeared, and
I gave him our story in a few words, for though a
German, he was well acquainted with our language.
‘An Irish general,’ said the apparently incredulous
Boniface, ‘and a Scotch poet!’ He left us with
the exclamation, and after he had gone, I proposed
a walk, to which my companion assenting, we
strolled around the city of Altona, and returned to
our lodgings, without having met with any occurrence
worthy of remark. Being somewhat fatigued, and
having no book, or other means of occupation, we
retired to our humble chamber, which had in it two
single beds, by no means luxurious.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Another week of anxiety passed away, and no
advices reached me. The poet and myself were in a
considerable stew. Another bill was presented, and
to our great surprise we found our host very lenient
indeed. He made no remark when presenting it—simply
asked me had I received my funds, and on expressing
my mortification that my reply must be in
the negative, he left me with a polite bow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘The accommodations,’ said the poet, ‘are here
none of the best, but our host is an honest fellow, we
have inspired him with confidence, and he appears
content to wait!’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know not how it was, but I felt a strange sensation
come over me, a feeling that relief was at
hand. So strongly was I impressed with this belief
that I communicated it to my friend, who laughed
out at what he called my Irish modest assurance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Relief,’ he said, ‘may come when your relations
hear of you, but my word for it, that will not
be soon. No, no, there is no relief, and I must leave
you for my continental tour.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He however yielded to my solicitation to walk,
which was always my resource, and as we left the
house, I said to him, ‘Campbell, when we come
back I shall hear something.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘If you do,’ said he, ‘it may be in the shape of
a dun for our unpaid bills.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘You will see,’ I replied; when we sallied
forth, and were gone perhaps an hour. On returning
to our room, judge of the sensation I experienced
when I discovered on the oaken table, a neat envelope
directed, in a female hand, ‘To Gen. A. McC.’
With an eagerness much more easily conceived than
described, I broke the seal—not a line of manuscript
did it contain—but for a moment my heart leaped
with joy, for I found within the envelope a Schleswig
Holstein bank bill of twenty dollars! Although
my surprise was without bounds—‘Did I not tell
you,’ said I to my friend, ‘that relief was at hand?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Our treasury was now replenished, and we had
a fruitful subject of conversation. Addressing himself
to his attentive listener, ‘I wish,’ said the
general, ‘you could have seen the stride with which
I paced up and down that room.’ Never in my
whole eventful life had I such commingled sensations.
My pride was gratified, that I could now
discharge our indebtedness to our host, while I
suffered the deepest humiliation in the reflection,
that I was considered an object of charity by some
unknown person! My curiosity was at fault to determine
who it could be, and I shall never forget
Campbell’s looks as he exclaimed, ‘You have conquered
here, if you could not in Ireland. But it is
Cupid who has been your aid. The hand-writing,
the neatness of the billet, and its diminutive proportions,
all declare it to be a <span class='it'>billet-doux</span>. My word
for it, your Irish complexion and figure have taken
captive the heart of some fair lady!’ This idea
greatly added to my embarrassment, but the pride
of being enabled to discharge our indebtedness, overcame
for the moment all my other sensations, and
strutting up to the bell, I rang it with so much violence,
that our landlord ran up in an instant, and demanded
to know what was the matter? ‘<span class='it'>Bring your
bill</span>,’ said I, ‘that I may at once discharge it.’ I
thought this would be the most agreeable intelligence
I could give him. What, then, was our joint
surprise, when he replied, ‘That, gentlemen, is of
no kind of importance; I pray of you give yourselves
no uneasiness on that score—you can pay me
at your convenience.’ Saying this, he departed,
leaving my friend and myself more deeply involved
in the mystery which had not only supplied us with
money, but which had also placed us in such ample
credit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘You see,’ said the poet, ‘you are known, and
Cupid has taken you under his special protection.
Let us call for wine, and pledge him, and the sweet
<span class='it'>heart</span> he has enlisted in your service, in a bottle of
the very best the house affords. Would for her sake
and our own it were nectar!’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The wine was ordered, and it was long before it
made its appearance, for it was a fluid unknown
within the precincts of our habitation; but it came
at last, and though none of the best, never was the
choicest Burgundy drunk with greater <span class='it'>gusto</span>, or a
toast given with a more hearty glee than inspired us
till we finished the second bottle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Time now passed more pleasantly. The second
Saturday brought another note, addressed in the
same hand-writing, containing a second bank-note of
the same amount. Finding our finances so much
improved we took better lodgings, and indulged ourselves
with more of the creature comforts, for the
unknown benefactor found us out in our new abode,
and continued the supply, which enabled us to do
so.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think,” continued the general, “it was in
the fourth week that I was returning to my lodgings
alone, in the dusk of the evening, when one of the
flag-stones of the pavement being somewhat raised
above its fellows, caused me to strike it with my
foot, and being thus thrown from my equilibrium, I
fell against the porch of a dwelling, in which was
seated a lady, who did not attract my attention until
I heard a voice, a sweet voice, which inquired if I
was hurt. A voice in my native tongue uttering
sounds of sympathy would have been accompanied
with a charm, come from whom it might; but imagine
the ecstasy with which I was thrilled when I
heard the sweet voice which addressed me, and
knew it to be from the lips of a fair daughter of the
Emerald Isle—in plain English, an Irish woman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘I hope you are not hurt, general?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘General!’ she knows me then, thought I.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Come,’ said she, ‘and rest yourself in the porch.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I could no longer contain myself. I had been
dining out with an acquaintance—for I had by this
time made one or two acquaintances—and the generous
wine I had imbibed had opened my heart, alive
as it was, to any and every accent of kindness to an
exile. I could contain myself no longer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell me,” said I, “by what blessed influence
I have been thus brought to listen to the sweet sympathizing
accents of a country-woman, and one who
appears to know me: for if I mistake not, you addressed
me by my title—the sad, sad title which calls
up all my afflictions, and revives the sad fate of my
companions in a strife which failed to benefit our beloved
country, proved fatal to one of the best men,
and sent me hither a wandering exile.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There,” said he, pointing to his wife, then present,
“there sits the angel of mercy, who poured into
my attentive ears—till they reached my inmost
soul—accents attuned to the most holy of all earthly
consolations: accents of sympathy for me, and the
most noble and heroic sentiments, applauding the
course of our dear native land.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now,” said the lady, “I pray of you do not
get into your heroics:” and addressing their guest,
she continued—“Receive what he says with many
allowances, for on this subject he is insane. I forgive
him, for he has suffered much in the cause of
that dear land from which we both derive our birth;
and you who know him know that he never thinks
or speaks of dear Erin and his exile—of a spot for
which he is ready to shed the last drop of his blood—that
his whole soul is not on fire. Of this he may
talk to you; and if you will listen to him he will do
so till to-morrow’s sun shall warm you with his meridian
rays—but I forbid him to talk of me and of our
union.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Forbid!” said the husband, “there is no such
word in the vocabulary. I will tell this to our friend,
for you know I love him. I will tell him how you
courted me, and how you saved me, and made me
what I am, your happy husband.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>To this the fond wife would reply, deprecating the
continuance of his narrative, which, however, did
not prevent him from doing ample justice to every
incident which occurred; from the time of their first
accidental meeting as here related, until Hymen had
sealed a union which had made both husband and
wife as happy as they could be under the circumstances
of his banishment. This was an eternal
source of chagrin and mortification to his heroic
soul; and never could Ireland be named within his
hearing, that the tear did not start in his eye.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The substance of his love affair was, that the
lady of whom we have spoken was an Irish lady,
who had come when a young woman with her parents
to Altona, had married a young German, who
did not long survive their union. She was left in
very comfortable circumstances, and hearing from
the keeper of the inn that a person was an inmate
with him, calling himself an Irish general, who had
been banished, and who had not heard from his
friends, and was without funds, she had sent him
the weekly supply which so much astonished the
poet and the general. The innkeeper—knowing the
lady to be an Irish woman—had gone to consult her
as to the probability of the general’s story, and had
been told to withhold nothing, and that she would be
responsible. Often did she tell the writer that she
sent the money without any expectation of ever seeing
the recipient, who was represented to her as so
fine-looking in person, that he could not be an impostor.
She believed him to be a veritable Irishman
in distress, and—that was enough—had she never
seen him, he was a countryman of hers, and had a
right to any thing she could do for him—happy to
have been furnished with an object to call forth her
patriotic feelings, to exercise them in his behalf was
her greatest delight. Pure accident had given her a
knowledge of who was the cause of calling them
forth, and his heart was touched and hers responded
to his love—they had been several years married
when the writer became an inmate with them—their
home was the abode of peace and contentment, and
a hospitality that knew no limits.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was enough that their guest was an American
to call forth all their patriotic feelings: and many
were there—besides the writer of this imperfect
sketch of so noble a character—that can join with
the writer in esteeming it a high honor, and a source
of extreme gratification to have been permitted to
know and to enjoy the society of the “Original
Erin-go-bragh.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His sentence of banishment was remitted many
years after the period here spoken of; and he was
permitted again to return to the home of his childhood,
and the land of his forefathers, for which he
had bled, and for the redemption of which he was
ever ready to lay down his life—but it was not
so ordered. He died in peace, and was buried
in the tomb of his ancestors. General Anthony
McCann was the veritable and original “Erin-go-bragh.”</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;font-size:0.8em;font-weight:bold;'>BY LIEUT. WM. F. LYNCH.</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1.5em;'>———</p>

<p class='pindent'>In each division of the American Continent, nature
seems to have carried on her operations with boundless
magnificence, and upon a gigantic scale. Chateaubriand,
reclining by his watch-fire on the banks
of the Niagara, where the thunders of its cataract
were only interrupted by the startling yell of the
Iroquois, could yet <span class='it'>feel</span>, in the midst of tumult, the
amazing silence and solitude of the North American
forest. And the hardy mariner, whose bark has
escaped the perils of the Southern sea, and is wafted
along the western coast of Chili, looks with no less
admiration upon the fertile plains gradually receding
into the swell of the Andes, which literally lifts its
smoking craters and towering eminences above the
clouds, and upon its snow-capped and sunny summits,
scarcely feels the undulations of the storms
which gather and burst around its waist.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With the stars and stripes of the Union floating
from the mast-head of our frigate, we were sailing
along that part of the coast of Chili, where the waving
line of the Andes rounds within a short distance of
the Pacific, and were unusually solicitous, after
the perils and privations of a tempestuous sea-voyage,
to tread upon a soil on which nature, from her
horn of abundance, has poured forth the choicest of
her gifts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Older sailors than ourselves had spoken of the
generous hospitality of the Spanish colonists, and
there were historical associations connected with
this favored land, well calculated to render a visit
agreeable. Who that has been nurtured in the lap
of freedom, would not long to look upon the only
race of native people on the western continent who
had never been subdued, and who, to this day, tread
the soil of their forefathers unvanquished and invincible?</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Araucanians, who inhabit the southern portion
of this delightful country, like the Saxons of the
European continent, are the only native race who
have successfully repelled every invader, and who,
happier than the Saxon, still rejoice in their unbridled
freedom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Neither Diego Almagro, with his brutal treachery,
nor Valverde, with his unsparing cruelty, could ever
subdue or intimidate a race of freemen whose liberties
still survive the frequent convulsions by which
they have been agitated. The flame of freedom
among this gallant people, like the volcanoes of their
native mountains, seems destined to burn on for ever
unextinguished. But I proposed to speak of the
Condor Hunt on the plains of Chili.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Every one has heard of the Condor or Great Vulture
of the Andes, rivaling in natural history, the
fabled feats of the Roc of Sinbad. Even the genius
of Humboldt has failed to strip this giant bird of its
time-honored renown, and his effort to reduce the
Chilian Condor to the level of the Lammergyer of
the Alps, is a signal failure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Although he has divested this mountain-bird of
all its fictitious attributes, and stripped a goodly portion
of romantic narrative of its wildest imagery,
yet the Condor still floats in the solitude of the
higher heavens, the monarch of the feathered race.
The favorite abiding-place of this formidable bird is
along a chain of mountains in our southern continent,
whose summits, lifted far above the clouds, are
robed in snow, which a torrid sun may kiss but never
melt. Above all animal life, and beyond the limit
of even mountain vegetation, these birds delight to
dwell, inhaling an air too highly attenuated to be
endured by other than creatures peculiarly adapted
to it. From the crown of these immense elevations
they slowly and lazily unfold their sweeping pinions,
and wheeling in wide and ascending circles, they
soar upward into the dark blue vault of heaven,
until their great bulk diminishes to the merest
speck, or is entirely lost to the aching sight of the
observer.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In those pure fields of ether, unvisited even by the
thunder-cloud, regions which may be regarded as
his own exclusive domain, the Condor delights to
sail, and with piercing glance survey the surface of
the earth, toward which he never stoops but at the
call of hunger. Surely this power to waft and to
sustain himself in the loftiest regions of the air—the
ability to endure, uninjured, the exceeding cold attendant
upon such remoteness from the earth, and
to breathe with ease in an atmosphere of such extreme
rarity—together with the keenness of sight
that, from such vast heights can minutely scan the
objects beneath, as well as the formidable powers
of this bird, when the herds are scattered before
him; were sufficiently admirable to entitle the Condor
to our attention, and to give us promise of goodly
sport in the approaching Condor or Lasso Hunt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A large landed proprietor, a descendant of one of
the early Spanish patentees, to whom we had been
indebted for abundant supplies of fruit and provisions,
as well as for numberless civilities, conveyed
to us at length the welcome tidings that the Condor,
numerous as the sands of the shore had stooped
from his sublime domain, to the base of the mountain,
and that the hunt would commence in the
morning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sun had scarcely risen in the heavens, when
our party of from twenty-five to thirty, sprang from
the boats to the beach. The plain before us ran in a
gently ascending slope to the base of the hill about
one mile distant. The hunt was up—and the field
in the distance was dotted with scampering herds of
cattle and groups of horsemen, mingled in one dusty
mêlée, the sight of which lent wings to our speed,
as vaulting into the deep Spanish saddles, prepared
by our worthy host, we sprang onward to the field
of blood. Impelled by the cravings of resistless appetite,
the Condor, regardless of danger, pressed
forward to assail the herds of the plain; while the
watchmen, having sounded the alarm, the numerous
population turned out, as well to protect their cattle,
as to hunt the mountain-bird—the Chilian’s manly
pastime.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From the midst of a canopy of dust, spread wide
over the plain, there came forth sounds of noisy conflict,
resembling the heady current of a “foughten
field;” and mountain and hill-side were shaken by
the shouts of the hunters, the tramp of scampering
horsemen, and the bellowing of enraged and affrighted
cattle. The Condor, alone, rapid as the
cassowary of the desert, pursued in silence his destined
prey. As we rapidly approached, we perceived
one of the herd bursting from the western
extremity of the cloud of dust, lashing his bleeding
side with his tail, and his blood-shotten eyes starting
wildly from their sockets, while foaming at the
mouth, he bellowed loudly with pain. With a wonderful
unity of purpose, he alone was closely pursued
by the whole flock of birds, who, disregarding the
other animals, seemed to follow, as with a single
will, this stricken one, who was at the same time
cautiously avoided by his terrified companions.
Like all gregarious birds, the Condor appeared to
have a leader, who, rushing at their head, into the
midst of the herd, pounced with his greedy beak
upon this devoted animal, the fattest and the sleekest
of the multitude, and tore a piece of flesh from his
side. Attracted by the sight or the scent of blood,
the whole flock, like a brood of harpies, joined in the
mad pursuit. Swift of foot as the fleetest racer,
they kept close to his side, ever and anon striking
with unerring sagacity at his eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tell me not of the gladiators of martial Rome, or
of the Tauridors of modern Seville—they were pastimes
for children, compared with the thrilling excitement
of the Condor Hunt. Away they fled, and
away we hurried in the chase. A thousand horsemen
were wheeling rapidly in pursuit—a thousand
cattle, terrified and frantic, swept over the plain—and
a thousand Condors mingled in the crowd—until,
by the rapid movement, herd and Condor were again
hidden from the view in clouds of dust. A loud
shout soon after attracted us to the scene of conflict.
Bursting forth once again from the cloud of dust
into which he had vainly rushed, the devoted animal
plunged madly forward, yet more closely followed
by the whole field of vultures. Black with dust, and
streaming with blood from a hundred wounds inflicted
by the remorseless beaks of his pursuers, he
still fled onward, but with diminished speed. As if
looking to man for assistance in his extremity, he
rushed through the midst of our cavalcade, and the
Condor, regardless of our presence, hung upon his
side, or followed in his foot-prints.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From the altered movement of the animal after he
had passed us, with his head on high, plunging and
blundering over the uneven ground, it was evident
that his course was no longer directed by sight.
His eyes were gone—they had been torn from their
bleeding sockets!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wearied and panting, his tongue hangs from his
mouth, and every thirsty beak is upon it. Still onward
he flies, hopeful of escape—and onward presses
the Condor, secure of his prey. The animal now
appeared to be dashing for the water, but his declining
speed and unequal step rendered it doubtful
whether he could reach it. He seemed suddenly to
despair of doing so, for wheeling round with one last
and desperate effort, he gathered himself up in the
fullness of his remaining strength, and rushed into
the midst of the herd, as if he sought by mingling in
the living mass, to divert the attention of his pursuers.
But the mark and the scent of blood was
upon him, and on the track of blood the Condor is
untiring and relentless. Beast and bird once again
were lost to view beneath the curtain of dust which
overspread the trembling plain. But, in a few moments,
pursued by every bird, he broke from the
midst of the herd, and made a few desperate plunges
toward the water, and reeling onward, fell at length
bleeding and exhausted, on the very margin of the
sea!</p>

<p class='pindent'>In an instant he was buried up among his pursuers,
his flesh torn off, yet quivering, by hungry
beaks, and his smoking entrails trailed upon the
ground. In the distance, on the verge of the horizon,
the last of the herd might still be discerned,
flying upon the wings of the wind from the fate of
their companion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Our host gave the signal, and we hurried to the
spot to rescue the carcass, with a view to visit upon
the Condor vengeance for the mischief he had done,
and the blood he had spilled. At our near approach
they took reluctantly and lazily to wing, and wheeling
in oblique circles, they were soon seen floating
over the crest of the mountain, dark specks in the
firmament. The hunters, prepared with stakes about
seven feet in length, commenced driving them in
the ground, a few inches apart, and in a circular
form around the carcass, leaving a small space open.
As soon as we retired from the spot, the birds descended
upon the plain, and entering the inclosure,
renewed their feast, and again took wing. In the
course of a few hours, the huntsmen returned, and
throwing into the pen an additional supply of food,
drove down other stakes in the open space, leaving
just sufficient room for the admission of the
Condor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The birds, more numerous than ever, returned to
their filthy banquet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meanwhile, having refreshed our horses, and partaken
of the hospitality of our worthy host, we
once more took the field for vengeance on the
gorged and lazy foe. As the wings of these birds
have a sweep of seventeen feet, <a id='they'></a>they are not readily
unfurled, so that when the Condor has alighted on
the plain, he is only enabled to rise by running over
a space of fifteen or twenty rods, and gradually gathering
wind to lift himself on high. While in the
midst of their ravenous feast, a few of the hunters
warily approached and closed the opening; and thus,
unable to soar aloft from a spot so confined and
crowded, the Condors were captive. But a Chilian
scorns thus to slay a foe. Armed with a lasso, each
of the natives sits upon his horse, eagerly awaiting
the turning loose of half a dozen birds from the inclosure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They are out—and away scamper the Condor,
fleet as the winds of heaven—and away, in rapid
pursuit, wheels the mounted Chilian, swinging
around his head the noose of the unerring lasso,
which, falling upon the neck of the bird, makes him
captive. The line is played out, and away sweeps
the powerful bird, and away the practiced horseman
after him. Springing upward, the Condor now unfolds
his wings and flutters in such width of circle
as the rope will permit—and now shoots perpendicularly
upward—and now falls headlong, and is trailed
exhausted on the ground.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The lengthened shadows of evening had fallen
along the plain before the sport was up, and the last
Condor was captured. We returned to our ship,
well pleased with the entertainment, and swinging
into our hammocks sunk into deep slumber, for
which the exercise of the day had prepared us—but
our sleep was not too sound for refreshing visitations
from friends far away,</p>

<div><h1><a id='what'></a>WHAT GLORY COSTS THE NATION.</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>In the February number, we gave a short extract
from Upham’s Manual of Peace, in relation to the
cost of the Army and Navy of the United States.
That article has brought out an officer of the Navy,
with the following—in which we get abuse for facts,
and sharp sentences for figures. We can stand a
moderate amount of flaying without blubbering, and
have no faith in the theory that a drop of ink will
raise a blister, except upon persons exceedingly thin-skinned.
But our correspondent, who takes a narrow
view of both <span class='it'>time and figures</span>, appears to think the
question a new one, and settled by his article, and
both Upham and Graham demolished.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sir,—Freedom of speech, and freedom of the
press, are among the best privileges guarantied by a
republican form of government; but freedom of
speech is not to be taken as a license to state for
fact what is not true without possibility of contradiction.
Nor is freedom of speech to be construed
into a privilege of saying sharp or impertinent and
impudent things with impunity. It has been said as
a rule, ‘joke as much as you please, but never trespass
on fact,’ which means, when you fall into an
error, you are bound to correct it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“With these notions fresh upon me, I venture to
point out an erroneous statement in the first page of
the February number of Graham, which is calculated
to prejudice a large number of people against
the Navy and Army of the country. Graham
(Upham) states that the cost of maintaining the
Army and Navy of the United States is equal to
eighty per cent., that is, four-fifths of the entire revenue.
This must strike every reflecting mind to be
an expense so enormous as to render it desirable to
be rid of both Army and Navy. But the statement
is entirely erroneous, as a moment’s thought will
show. If four-fifths of the revenue are absorbed in
maintaining the Army and Navy, only one fifth is
left to meet the expense of the ‘civil list,’ president
and officers of the cabinet, foreign ministers and consuls,
custom-house officers, light-houses, etc. etc.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So that in round numbers, the expense of the
Army and Navy together, is about one-fourth, or
twenty-five per cent. of the revenue instead of 80
per cent., as stated, which is an excess of at least
55 per cent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It should not be forgotten, however, that twenty-five
per cent. of the whole revenue for military
establishments is a large proportion; but without
these establishments, it is possible we might soon
be entirely without revenue, because our commerce,
without a navy, would be open to the depredation
of pirates of all nations, and might be crippled if not
totally destroyed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The expense of keeping a dog may be considerable;
but if that dog protects us from thieves
and burglars, the money spent for his maintenance
may be regarded as money well laid out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The expense of the military establishments is
not their fault or sin; but the evil is to be attributed
to the ignorance of mankind. When the whole world
becomes educated and instructed, all wars will be
conducted with pen and ink, and aid of arithmetic.
Sensible men, while in their senses, never cut each
other’s throats for differences of opinion; they argue
the difference; and he who has most logic and good
sense, is always willing to ‘do to others as he would
others should do unto him.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Therefore, friend Graham (Upham) continue to
teach your readers <span style='font-size:smaller'>TRUTH</span>, and they will acquire so
strong a sense of justice, as to do away with any
necessity for fighting among themselves or against
others.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Well, we will “<span class='it'>continue</span> to teach our readers
<span class='it'>truth</span>,” and the advice points a moral. Navy <span class='it'>officers
are bad logicians</span>!—but are a pretty good set of
fellows so long as they are paid well for the fighting
that <span class='it'>may be done</span>, in the next generation; and are
allowed to say themselves, that “the expense of the
military establishments is to be attributed to the
ignorance of mankind,” without using any means to
enlighten mankind upon the subject.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Since our correspondent finds fault with us, or
Upham, about his facts and figures, we give him the
following from a gentleman<a id='r3'/><a href='#f3' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[3]</span></sup></a> who has paid some
attention to the matter, and ask him to look the question
in the face fairly, and answer the arguments and
figures, and if he makes out but a partial case, we
will publish his reply, however sharp and acrid.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I do not propose to dwell upon the immense cost
of War itself. That will be present to the minds of all,
in the mountainous accumulations of debt, piled like
Ossa upon Pelion, with which Europe is pressed to
the earth. According to the most recent tables to
which I have had access, the public debt of the
different European States, so far as it is known,
amounts to the terrific sum of $6,387,000,000, all of
this the growth of War! It is said that there are
throughout these states, 17,900,000 paupers, or persons
subsisting at the expense of the country, without
contributing to its resources. If these millions of
the public debt, forming only a part of what has been
wasted in War, could be apportioned among these
poor, it would give to each of them $375, a sum
which would place all above want, and which is
about equal to the average value of the property of
each inhabitant of Massachusetts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The public debt of Great Britain reached in 1839
to $4,265,000,000, the growth of War since 1688!
This amount is nearly equal to the sum-total, according
to the calculations of Humboldt, of all the
treasures which have been reaped from the harvest of
gold and silver in the mines of Spanish America,
including Mexico and Peru, since the first discovery
of our hemisphere by Christopher Columbus! It is
much larger than the mass of all precious metals,
which at this moment form the circulating medium
of the world! It is sometimes rashly said by those
who have given little attention to this subject, that
all this expenditure was widely distributed, and
therefore beneficial to the people; but this apology
does not bear in mind that it was not bestowed in
any productive industry, or on any <span class='it'>useful</span> object.
The magnitude of this waste will appear by a contrast
with other expenditures; the aggregate capital
of all the joint stock companies in England, of which
there was any known record in 1842, embracing canals,
docks, bridges, insurance companies, banks,
gas-lights, water, mines, railways, and other miscellaneous
objects, was about $835,000,000; a sum
which has been devoted to the welfare of the people,
but how much less in amount than the War
Debt! For the six years ending in 1836, the average
payment for the interest on this debt was about
$140,000,000 annually. If we add to this sum,
$60,000,000 during this same period paid annually to
the army, navy and ordnance, we shall have
$200,000,000 as the annual tax of the English people,
to pay for former wars and to prepare for new.
During this same period there was an annual appropriation
of only $20,000,000 for all the civil purposes
of the Government. It thus appears that <span class='it'>War</span> absorbed
ninety cents of every dollar that was pressed
by heavy taxation from the English people, who almost
seem to sweat blood! What fabulous monster,
or chimera dire, ever raged with a maw so ravenous?
The remaining ten cents sufficed to maintain
the splendor of the throne, the administration
of justice, and the diplomatic relations with foreign
powers, in short, all the proper objects of a Christian
State.<a id='r4'/><a href='#f4' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[4]</span></sup></a></p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus much for the general cost of War. Let us
now look exclusively at the <span class='it'>Preparations for War
in time of peace</span>. It is one of the miseries of War,
that, even in peace, its evils continue to be felt by
the world, beyond any other evils by which poor
suffering Humanity is oppressed. If Bellona withdraws
from the field, we only lose the sight of her flaming
torches; the bay of her dogs is heard on the
mountains, and civilized man thinks to find protection
from their sudden fury, only by inclosing himself
in the barbarous armor of battle. At this moment
the Christian nations, worshiping a symbol of
common brotherhood, live as in entrenched camps
in which they keep armed watch, to prevent surprise
from each other. Recognizing the <span class='it'>custom</span> of War
as a proper Arbiter of Justice, they hold themselves
perpetually ready for the bloody umpirage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is difficult, if not impossible, to arrive at any
exact estimate of the cost of these preparations,
ranging under four different heads; the Standing
Army; the Navy; the Fortifications and Arsenals;
and the Militia or irregular troops.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The number of soldiers now affecting to keep the
peace of European Christendom, as a <span class='it'>Standing
Army</span>, without counting the Navy, is upward of two
millions. Some estimates place it as high as three
millions. The army of Great Britain exceeds 300,000
men; that of France 350,000; that of Russia 730,000,
and is reckoned by some as high as 1,000,000; that
of Austria 275,000; that of Prussia 150,000. Taking
the smaller number, suppose these two millions to
require for their annual support an average sum of
only $150 each, the result would be $300,000,000,
for their sustenance alone; and reckoning one officer
to ten soldiers, and allowing to each of the latter an
English shilling a day, or $87 a year, for wages, and
to the former an average salary of $500 a year, we
should have for the pay of the whole no less than
$256,000,000, or an appalling sum-total for both sustenance
and pay of $556,000,000. If the same calculation
be made, supposing the forces to amount to
three millions, the sum-total will be $835,000,000!
But to this enormous sum another still more enormous
must be added on account of the loss sustained
by the withdrawal of two millions of hardy, healthy
men, in the bloom of life, from useful, productive
labor. It is supposed that it costs an average sum
of $500 to rear a soldier; and that the value of his
labor, if devoted to useful objects, would be $150 a
year. The Christian Powers, therefore, in setting
apart two millions of men, as soldiers, sustain a loss
of $1,000,000,000 on account of their training; and
$300,000,000 annually, on account of their labor, in
addition to the millions already mentioned as annually
expended for sustenance and pay. So much for the
cost of the standing army of European Christendom
in time of Peace.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Glance now at the <span class='it'>Navy</span> of European Christendom.
The Royal Navy of Great Britain consists at
present of 557 ships of all classes; but deducting such
as are used for convict ships, floating chapels, coal
depots, the efficient navy consists of 88 sail of the
line; 109 frigates; 190 small frigates, corvettes, brigs
and cutters, including packets; 65 steamers of various
sizes; 3 troop-ships and yachts; in all 455 ships.
Of these there were in commission in 1839, 190
ships, carrying in all 4,202 guns. The number of
hands employed was 34,465. The Navy of France,
though not comparable in size with that of England,
is of vast force. By royal ordinance of 1st January,
1837, it was fixed in time of peace at 40 ships of the
line, 50 frigates, 40 steamers, and 190 smaller vessels;
and the amount of crews in 1839, was 20,317.
The Russian Navy consists of two large fleets in
the Gulf of Finland and the Black Sea; but the exact
amount of their force and their available resources
has been a subject of dispute among naval men and
politicians. Some idea of the size of the navy may
be derived from the number of hands employed.
The crews of the Baltic fleet amounted in 1837, to
not less than 30,800 men; and those of the fleet in
the Black Sea to 19,800, or altogether 50,600. The
Austrian Navy consisted in 1837, of 8 ships of the
line, 8 frigates, 4 sloops, 6 brigs, 7 schooners or galleys,
and a number of smaller vessels; the number
of men in its service in 1839, was 4,547. The Navy
of Denmark consisted at the close of 1837, of 7 ships
of the line, 7 frigates, 5 sloops, 6 brigs, 3 schooners,
5 cutters, 58 gun-boats, 6 gun-rafts, and 3 bomb-vessels,
requiring about 6,500 men to man them. The
Navy of Sweden and Norway consisted recently of
238 gun-boats, 11 ships of the line, 8 frigates, 4 corvettes,
6 brigs, with several smaller vessels. The
Navy of Greece consists of 32 ships of war, carrying
190 guns, and 2,400 men. The Navy of Holland in
1839 consisted of 8 ships of the line, 21 frigates, 15
corvettes, 21 brigs, and 95 gun-boats. Of the immense
cost of all these mighty Preparations for
War, it is impossible to give any accurate idea.
But we may lament that means, so gigantic, should
be applied by European Christendom to the erection
in time of Peace, of such superfluous wooden
walls!</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the <span class='it'>Fortifications and Arsenals</span> of Europe,
crowning every height, commanding every valley,
and frowning over every plain and every sea, wealth
beyond calculation has been sunk. Who can tell the
immense sums that have been expended in hollowing
out, for the purposes of War, the living rock of
Gibraltar? Who can calculate the cost of all the
Preparations at Woolwich, its 27,000 cannons, and
its hundreds of thousands of small arms? France
alone contains upward of one hundred and twenty
fortified places. And it is supposed that the yet unfinished
fortifications of Paris have cost upward of
<span class='it'>fifty millions of dollars</span>!</p>

<p class='pindent'>The cost of the <span class='it'>Militia</span> or irregular troops, the
Yeomanry of England, the National Guards of Paris,
and the <span class='it'>Landwehr</span> and <span class='it'>Landsturm</span> of Prussia, must
add other incalculable sums to these enormous
amounts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Turn now to the <span class='it'>United States</span>, separated by a
broad ocean from immediate contact with the great
powers of Christendom, bound by treaties of amity and
commerce with all the nations of the earth; connected
with all by the strong ties of mutual interest;
and professing a devotion to the principles of Peace.
Are the Treaties of Amity mere words? Are the
relations of commerce and mutual interest mere
things of a day? Are the professions of Peace vain?
Else why not repose in quiet, unvexed by Preparations
for War?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Enormous as are the expenses of this character in
Europe, those in our own country are still greater in
proportion to the other expenditures of the Federal
Government.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It appears that the average <span class='it'>annual</span> expenditure
of the Federal Government for the six years ending
with 1840, exclusive of payments on account of debt,
were $26,474,892. Of this sum the average appropriation
each year for military and naval purposes
amounted to $21,328,903, being eighty per cent. of
the whole amount! Yes; of all the annual appropriations
by the Federal Government, eighty cents
in every dollar were applied in this irrational and
unproductive manner. The remaining twenty cents
sufficed to maintain the Government in all its
branches, Executive, Legislative, and Judicial, the
administration of justice, our relations with foreign
nations, the post-office and all the light-houses, which—in
happy useful contrast with any forts—shed their
cheerful signals over the rough waves beating upon
our long and indented coast, from the bay of Fundy
to the mouth of the Mississippi. A table of the relative
expenditure of nations, for military Preparations
in time of Peace, exclusive of payments on account
of the debts, presents results which will surprise
the advocates of economy in our country.
These are in proportion to the whole expenditure of
Government:</p>

<p class='pindent'>In Austria, as 33 per cent.,</p>

<p class='pindent'>In France, as 38 per cent.,</p>

<p class='pindent'>In Prussia, as 44 per cent.,</p>

<p class='pindent'>In Great Britain, as 74 per cent.,</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the <span class='sc'>United States</span>, as 80 per cent.!<a id='r5'/><a href='#f5' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[5]</span></sup></a></p>

<p class='pindent'>To this magnificent waste by the Federal Government,
may be added the still larger and equally superfluous
expenses of the Militia throughout the
country, placed recently by a candid and able writer,
at $50,000,000 a year!<a id='r6'/><a href='#f6' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[6]</span></sup></a></p>

<p class='pindent'>By a table<a id='r7'/><a href='#f7' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[7]</span></sup></a> of the expenditures of the United
States, exclusive of payments on account of the
Public Debt, it appears, that, <span class='it'>in the fifty-three years
from the formation of our present Government</span>, from
1789 down to 1843, $246,620,055 have been expended
for civil purposes, comprehending the executive, the
legislature, the judiciary, the post office, light-houses,
and intercourse with foreign governments. During
this same period $368,626,594 have been devoted to
the military establishment, and $170,437,684 to the
naval establishment; the two forming an aggregate
of $538,964,278. Deducting from this sum the appropriations
during three years of war, and we shall
find that more than <span class='it'>four hundred millions</span> were absorbed
by vain Preparations in time of peace for
War. Add to this amount a moderate sum for the
expenses of the Militia during the same period,
which, as we have already seen, have been placed
recently at $50,000,000 a year; for the past years
we may take an average of $25,000,000; and we
shall have the enormous sum of $1,335,000,000 to be
added to the $400,000,000; the whole amounting to
<span class='it'>seventeen hundred and thirty-five millions</span> of dollars,
a sum beyond the conception of human faculties,
sunk under the sanction of the Government of
the United States in mere <span class='it'>peaceful Preparations
for War</span>; more than <span class='it'>seven times</span> as much as was
dedicated by the Government, during the same period,
to all other purposes whatsoever!</p>

<p class='pindent'>From this serried array of figures the mind instinctively
retreats. If we examine them from a
nearer point of view, and, selecting some particular
part, compare it with the figures representing other
interests in the community, they will present a
front still more dread. Let us attempt the comparison.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Within a short distance of this city (Boston) stands
an institution of learning, which was one of the earliest
cares of the early forefathers of the country, the
conscientious Puritans. Favored child of an age of
trial and struggle, carefully nursed through a period
of hardship and anxiety, endowed at that time by
the oblations of men like Harvard, sustained from
its first foundation by the paternal arm of the Commonwealth,
by a constant succession of munificent
bequests and by the prayers of all good men, the
University of Cambridge now invites our homage as
the most ancient, the most interesting, and the most
important seat of learning in the land; possessing
the oldest and most valuable library, one of the
largest museums of mineralogy and natural history—a
School of Law, which annually receives into its
bosom more than one hundred and fifty sons from all
parts of the Union, where they listen to instruction
from professors whose names have become among
the most valuable possessions of the land—a School
of Divinity, the nurse of true learning and piety—one
of the largest and most flourishing Schools of
Medicine in the country—besides these, a general
body of teachers, twenty-seven in number, many of
whose names help to keep the name of the country
respectable in every part of the globe, where science,
learning, and taste are cherished—the whole presided
over at this moment by a gentleman, early distinguished
in public life by his unconquerable energies
and his masculine eloquence, at a later period, by
the unsurpassed ability with which he administered
the affairs of our city, and now in a green old age,
full of years and honor, preparing to lay down his
present high trust.<a id='r8'/><a href='#f8' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[8]</span></sup></a> Such is Harvard University;
and as one of the humblest of her children, happy in
the recollection of a youth nurtured in her classic retreats,
I cannot allude to her without an expression
of filial affection and respect.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It appears from the last Report of the Treasurer, that
the whole available property of the University, the
various accumulations of more than two centuries of
generosity, amounts to $703,175.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Change the scene, and cast your eyes upon another
object. There now swings idly at her moorings,
in this harbor, a ship of the line, the Ohio,
carrying ninety guns, finished as late as 1836 for
$547,888; repaired only two years after, in 1838, for
$223,012; with an armament which has cost $53,945;
making an amount of $834,845,<a id='r9'/><a href='#f9' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[9]</span></sup></a> as the actual cost at
this moment of that single ship; more than $100,000
beyond all the available accumulations of the richest
and most ancient seat of learning in the land!
Choose ye, my fellow-citizens of a Christian state,
between the two caskets—that wherein is the loveliness
of knowledge and truth, or that which contains
the carrion death.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I refer thus particularly to the Ohio, because she
happens to be in our waters. But in so doing I do
not take the strongest case afforded by our Navy.
Other ships have absorbed still larger sums. The
expense of the Delaware in 1842, had been <span class='it'>one million
and fifty-one thousand dollars</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pursue the comparison still further. The expenditures
of the University during the last year, for the
general purposes of the College, the instruction of
the Under-graduates, and for the Schools of Law
and Divinity, amount to $46,949. The cost of the
Ohio for one year in service, in salaries, wages, and
provisions, is $220,000; being $175,000 more than
the annual expenditures of the University; more
than <span class='it'>four times</span> as much. In other words, for the
annual sum which is lavished on one ship of the
line, <span class='it'>four</span> institutions, like Harvard University,
might be sustained throughout the country!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Still further let us pursue the comparison. The
pay of the Captain of a ship like the Ohio, is $4,500
when in service; $3,500, when on leave of absence,
or off duty. The salary of the President of the Harvard
University is $2,205; without leave of absence,
and never being off duty!</p>

<p class='pindent'>If the large endowments of Harvard University
are dwarfed by a comparison with the expense of a
single ship of the line, how much more must it be so
with those of other institutions of learning and beneficence,
less favored by the bounty of many generations.
The average cost of a sloop of war is $315,000;
more, probably, than all the endowments of those
twin stars of learning in the Western part of Massachusetts,
the Colleges at Williamstown and Amherst,
and of that single star in the East, the guide to many
ingenuous youth, the Seminary at Andover. The
yearly cost of a sloop of war in service is above
$50,000; more than the annual expenditures of these
three institutions combined.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I might press the comparison with other institutions
of Beneficence, with the annual expenditures
for the Blind—that noble and successful charity,
which has shed true lustre upon our Commonwealth—amounting
to $12,000; and the annual expenditures
for the Insane of the Commonwealth,
another charity dear to humanity, amounting to
$27,844.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Take all the Institutions of Learning and Beneficence,
the precious jewels of the Commonwealth,
the schools, colleges, hospitals and asylums, and the
sums, by which they have been purchased and preserved,
are trivial and beggarly, compared with the
treasures squandered within the borders of Massachusetts,
in vain preparations for War. There is
the Navy Yard at Charleston, with its stores on
hand, all costing $4,741,000; the Fortifications in
the harbors of Massachusetts, in which incalculable
sums have been already sunk, and in which it is
now proposed to sink $3,853,000 more;<a id='r10'/><a href='#f10' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[10]</span></sup></a> and besides
the Arsenal at Springfield, containing in 1842,
175,118 muskets, valued at $2,999,998,<a id='r11'/><a href='#f11' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[11]</span></sup></a> and which
is fed by an annual appropriation of about $200,000;
but whose highest value will ever be, in the judgment
of all lovers of truth, that it inspired a poem,
which in its influence shall be mightier than a battle,
and shall endure when arsenals and fortifications
have crumbled to the earth. Some of the verses of
this Psalm of Peace may happily relieve the detail
of statistics, while they blend with my argument.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Look now for one moment at a high and peculiar
interest of the nation, the administration of justice.
Perhaps no part of our system is regarded, by the
enlightened sense of the country, with more pride
and confidence. To this, indeed, all the other concerns
of Government, all its complications of machinery
are in a manner subordinate, since it is for the
sake of justice that men come together in states and
establish laws. What part of the Government can
compare in importance, with the Federal Judiciary,
that great balance-wheel of the Constitution, controlling
the relations of the States to each other, the legislation
of Congress and of the States, besides private
interests to an incalculable amount? Nor can
the citizen, who discerns the True Glory of his
country, fail to recognize in the judicial labors of
<span class='sc'>Marshall</span>, now departed, and in the immortal judgments
of <span class='sc'>Story</span>, who is still spared to us—<span class='it'>cerus in
cœlum redeat</span>—a higher claim to admiration and gratitude
than can be found in any triumph of battle.
The expenses of the administration of justice
throughout the United States, under the Federal
Government, in 1842—embracing the salaries of the
judges, the cost of juries, court-houses, and all officers
thereof, in short, all the outlay by which justice,
according to the requirements of Magna Charta, is
carried to every man’s door—amounted to $560,990,
a larger sum than is usually appropriated for this
purpose, but how insignificant compared with the
cormorant demands of the Army and Navy!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Let me allude to one more <span class='it'>curiosity</span> of waste. It
appears, by a calculation founded on the expenses
of the Navy, that the average cost of each gun,
carried over the ocean, for one year, amounts to
about fifteen thousand dollars; a sum sufficient to
sustain ten or even twenty professors of Colleges,
and equal to the salaries of all the Judges of the
Supreme Court of Massachusetts and the Governor
combined!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Such are a few brief illustrations of the tax which
the nations constituting the great Federation of
civilization, and particularly our own country, impose
on the people in time of profound peace, for no
permanent, productive work, for no institution of
learning, for no gentle charity, for no purpose of
good. As we wearily climb, in this survey, from
expenditure to expenditure, from waste to waste, we
seem to pass beyond the region of ordinary calculation;
Alps on Alps arise, on whose crowning heights
of everlasting ice, far above the habitations of man,
where no green thing lives, where no creature draws
its breath, we behold the cold, sharp, flashing glacier
of War.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the contemplation of this spectacle the soul
swells with alternate despair and hope; with despair,
at the thought of such wealth, capable of rendering
such service to Humanity, not merely wasted
but given to perpetuate Hate; with hope, as the
blessed vision arises of the devotion of all these incalculable
means to the purposes of Peace. The
whole world labors at this moment with poverty and
distress; and the painful question occurs to every
observer, in Europe more than here at home—what
shall become of the poor—the increasing Standing
Army of the Poor. Could the humble voice that
now addresses you, penetrate those distant counsels,
or counsels nearer home, it would say, disband your
Standing Armies of soldiers, apply your Navies to
purposes of peaceful and enriching commerce, abandon
your Fortifications and Arsenals, or dedicate them
to works of Beneficence, as the statue of Jupiter
Capitolinus was changed to the image of a Christian
saint; in fine, utterly forsake the present incongruous
system of <span class='it'>armed</span> Peace.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That I may not seem to press to this conclusion
with too much haste, at least as regards our own
country, I shall consider briefly, as becomes the occasion,
the asserted usefulness of the national armaments
which it is proposed to abandon, and shall
next expose the outrageous fallacy—at least in the
present age, and among the Christian Nations, of the
maxim by which alone they are vindicated, that in
time of Peace we must prepare for War.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>What is the use of the Standing Army of the
United States?</span> It has been a principle of freedom,
during many generations, to avoid a standing army;
and one of the complaints in the Declaration of Independence
was, that George III. had quartered large
bodies of troops in the colonies. For the first years
after the adoption of the Federal Constitution—during
our weakness, before our power was assured,
before our name had become respected in the family
of nations, under the administration of Washington—a
small sum was deemed ample for the military
establishment of the United States. It was only
when the country, at a later day, had been touched
by martial insanity, that, in unworthy imitation of
monarchical states, it abandoned the true economy of
a Republic, and lavished the means which it begrudged
to the purposes of Peace, in vain preparation
for War. It may now be said of our army, as
Dunning said of the influence of the crown, it has increased,
is increasing, and ought to be diminished.
At this moment there are, in the country, more than
fifty-five military posts. It would be difficult to assign
a reasonable apology for any of these—unless, perhaps,
on some distant Indian frontier. Of what use is
the detachment of the second regiment of Artillery in
the quiet town of New London in Connecticut? Of
what use is the detachment of the first regiment of
Artillery in that pleasant resort of fashion, Newport?
By their exhilarating music and showy parade they
may serve to amuse an idle hour, but it is doubtful
if emotions of a different character will not be aroused
in generous bosoms. Surely, he must have lost
something of his sensibility to the true dignity of human
nature, who, without regret and mortification,
can observe the discipline, the drill, the unprofitable
marching and counter-marching—the putting guns to
the shoulder and then dropping them to the earth—which
fill the lives of the poor soldiers, and prepare
them to become the rude, inanimate parts of that
<span class='it'>machine</span>, to which an army has been likened by the
great living master of the Art of War. And this
sensibility must be more offended by the spectacle
of a chosen body of ingenuous youth, under the auspices
of the Government, amidst the bewitching
scenery of West Point, painfully trained to these
same fantastic and humiliating exercises—at a cost
to the country since the establishment of this Academy,
of upwards of four millions of dollars.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In Europe, Standing Armies are supposed to be
needed to sustain the power of Governments; but
this excuse cannot prevail here. The monarchs of
the Old World, like the chiefs of the ancient German
tribes, are upborne by the shields of the soldiery.
Happily with us the Government springs from the
hearts of the people, and needs no janizaries for its
support.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But I hear the voice of some defender of this
abuse, some upholder of this “rotten borough” of
our Constitution, crying, the Army is needed for the
defense of the country! As well might you say that
the shadow is needed for the defense of the body;
for what is the army of the United States but the
feeble shadow of the power of the American people?
<span class='it'>In placing the army on its present footing, so small
in numbers compared with the forces of the great
European States, our Government has tacitly admitted
its superfluousness for defense.</span> It only remains
to declare distinctly, that the country will repose
in the consciousness of right, without the wanton
excess of supporting soldiers, lazy consumers of
the fruits of the earth, who might do the State good
service in the various departments of useful industry.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>What is the use of the Navy of the United States?</span>
The annual expense of our Navy, during recent
years, has been upward of six millions of dollars.
For what purpose is this paid? Not for the apprehension
of pirates; for frigates and ships of the line
are of too great bulk to be of service for this purpose.
Not for the suppression of the Slave Trade; for
under the stipulations with Great Britain, we employ
only eighty guns in this holy alliance. Not to protect
our coasts; for all agree that our few ships
would form an unavailing defense against any serious
attack. Not for these purposes, you will admit, <span class='it'>but
for the protection of our Navigation</span>. This is not
the occasion for minute calculations. Suffice it to
say, that an intelligent merchant, who has been extensively
engaged in commerce for the last twenty
years, and who speaks, therefore, with the authority
of knowledge, has demonstrated in a tract of perfect
clearness, that the annual profits of the whole mercantile
marine of the country do not equal the annual
expenditure of our Navy. Admitting the profit of a
merchant ship to be four thousand dollars a year,
which is a large allowance, it will take the earnings
of one hundred ships to build and employ for one
year a single sloop of War—one hundred and fifty
ships to build and employ a frigate, and nearly three
hundred ships to build and employ a ship of the line.
Thus more than five hundred ships must do a profitable
business, in order to earn a sufficient sum to
sustain this little fleet. Still further, taking a received
estimate of the value of the mercantile marine
of the United States at forty millions of dollars,
we find that it is only a little more than six times the
annual cost of the navy; so that this interest is protected
at a charge of more than <span class='it'>fifteen per cent.</span> of
its whole value! Protection at such price is more
ruinous than one of Pyrrhus’s victories!</p>

<p class='pindent'>In our last number we proposed to give a short

young men as chance and association have
made us intimate with, that we might thereby incite

whose name is embalmed in all true hearts as the
intrepid ruling elder in that Band of Heroes and unbending
worshipers of freedom of conscience, who
landed from the Mayflower at Plymouth, in December
1620. The heroism of Brewster, Robinson and
others of that immortal band of brave men and women,
prior to their embarkation at Holland, are facts
of history, and as familiar to every student as their subsequent
trials and dauntless energy in braving them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Brewster’s family were originally from New
Jersey. A descendant of Elder Brewster’s removed
from Plymouth to New Jersey, and there Mr. B. H.
Brewster, his great-grandson, was born. In his mother’s
family a great-grandfather—a Duval, was a refugee
Huguenot—“one of that handful of whom the
world was not worthy, who without stain, without
reproach, were crushed to the dust, were delivered up
to the rack, the scourge, the dungeon, the stake, as if
accursed of Heaven, until at last a weeping and bleeding
remnant of them found their way to our land and
poured into our veins the rich stream of Huguenot
blood.” Thus from both sides of his house he inherits
rich, old democratic blood. Puritan and Huguenot
blood. Blood that an American may be proud of.
His ancestors assisted in planting that holy seed of
Liberty which has sprung into so mighty a tree, and
under whose thick spreading branches the oppressed
of all nations find shelter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Brewster was born in Salem county, New
Jersey, during a transient residence of his parents in
that place. When only a few months old his parents
returned to their former residence in Philadelphia,
where he has ever since lived. He early gave promise
of great quickness of intellect, but from his
earliest childhood he was particularly remarkable
for strict truthfulness and integrity—he scorned a lie,
even an evasion, though it might save him the
dreaded humiliation of punishment. “Manly, straightforward,
upright,” were words always applied to
him by those who knew him in youth, and these
qualities made him a stay and a comfort to his family
at an age when most young men are dependents.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He left the preparatory school of Dr. Wiltbank at
fourteen and entered the University of Pennsylvania,
but was removed from it six months after to Princeton
College, where he graduated at the age of eighteen
years, and commenced the study of law in this city,
in the office of Eli K. Price, Esq. In 1837, at the
age of 21 years, he became a member of the Philadelphia
bar. Starting on the road of life in that
most arduous of all professions, the law, with few
friends, he early exhibited those peculiar traits of
fitness for his profession that so speedily placed him
among its leaders. His success has been remarkable—not
in the sense of the world generally—but in the
substantial character of his business, and in his position
among his brethren of the bar. He early saw
the door of distinction open to him, and resolved to
pass its threshold and make for himself an honorable
name. With that industry and energy that are part
of his character, he speedily, while yet a young man,
rose in his profession, and took a prominent place
among the best of that bar, long since acknowledged
to be the strongest in the country. His mind is
Analytical in an eminent degree, it perceives and
grasps with a quickness, oftentimes wonderful, the
strong points of a case, which are lucidly put before
the jury. He uses little ornament, as we
usually understand it, though he has at times
shown his ability to wield that most effective
of all the orator’s weapons; he presents in a
brief, sententious style, with all the force that
such a style is so naturally fitted for the gist of
his case. His forte as a lawyer is before the court
in banc upon a question of law—the forum that tests
the real ability of so many—where mere speech-making—the
tinsel and clap-trap of the profession
pass at their real value, and where mind alone is the
genuine currency—where educated minds are to be
taught, altered, or convinced. In this department
of his profession Mr. Brewster is at home, and brings
to bear on the argument of his cases, all the powers
of his peculiarly well-stored mind. He is by no
means, however, deficient before a jury, as many
of our citizens will recollect, in recalling to mind
his many triumphs in this city. While he is kind
to his colleagues, he is respectful but independent
in his bearing toward the Court, but permitting no
undue interference in his or his client’s business, yet
giving to all the respect that position or talents should
demand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Brewster’s appearance before the Court is
impressive. Thoughtful, earnest, and of fine manners,
he at once impresses you with the importance
of his cause, and that that which he is about
to say is the result of no passing thought, but of care
and deliberation—graceful and dignified in his manner
he yet becomes, when warm with his subject, vehement
without losing his self-possession, oftentimes
treading a little out of his path to indulge in a pleasantry
to relieve the dry detail of legal discussion,
still maintaining the thread and course of his argument.
Always courteous in an eminent degree to
his adversary, high-toned and honorable in all his
intercourse with the world, he exhibits it in argument,
by refusing at all times to pervert facts, to
overstrain or misstate the well-settled law of the
land. He is ready and apt; exhibiting his readiness,
and the ability with which he has prepared his case
by the prompt answers of points against him suggested
during argument by the Court or his adversary.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Kingman, the highly talented and veteran
correspondent of the New York Journal of Commerce,
said of him, “His (Mr. Brewster’s) manner
is happy and winning—his voice mellow and flowing,
and, as Mr. Wirt used to say of one of his
favorites, he can render interesting to any auditory
the dryest legal citation by the magical effect
of his tasteful reading.” His talents as a lawyer
have drawn him from our local courts, and the
scenes of his greatest success have been in that
“strongest of Courts” the Supreme Court of the
United States at Washington. In a case that now
presents itself to our mind, he more than distinguished
himself—we mention, we are sure, from its
public character, and the importance of the questions
involved to all, a familiar case, when we
name “The United States vs. The County of
Philadelphia.” It involved the great constitutional
question of the right of a State Government to tax
the unceded realty of the United States necessary
for the purposes of the Federal Government. This
was a question particularly suited to the turn of mind
of Mr. Brewster, and it was to be argued before a
Court, the ablest and the brightest in the land. His
argument elicited from all parts the highest and
the warmest praise. The New York Tribune, a
paper of high character for ability and impartiality,
says, that “a long, elaborate, and powerful argument
was delivered before the Supreme Court yesterday
by Benjamin H. Brewster, of Philadelphia,
which has produced a great impression in our legal
circles, and secured at once for Mr. Brewster the
reputation of being one of the ablest constitutional
lawyers in the country. The principle to be defined
and settled in the case in which Mr. B. is engaged,
is of the highest importance, and the whole
country is certainly greatly indebted to the learning
and eloquence of that gentleman for the convincing
manner in which he pointed out and defined the
rights of the States, and the ability with which he
defended those rights against Federal encroachment.”
The New York Journal of Commerce said of it,
“Mr. Brewster’s argument necessarily embraced
some detail, and some citations, and various illustrations,
and still he managed to bring it all within
the compass of less than two hours. Mr. Brewster
is a rising star, and destined at no distant day to become
a shining light of the federal tribunal.” And
these are but two, selected at random from a host
of such compliments. The result showed the truth
of these views of Mr. Brewster’s argument.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His argument in this now famous case, was not
published, notwithstanding the urgent request of
many friends that it should be—with a modesty that
we think false, but which is usually the attendant
upon real ability, he was contented with having
done work well without seeking by parade to make it
the medium of pecuniary benefit. His character does
not, of course, stand upon this case alone, as the records
of the court at Washington will show, though,
in truth, it might stand on a less secure foundation.
Almost as a necessary consequence of Mr. Brewster’s
professional life, he has been more or less identified
with the various political questions of the day.
Early in life he attached himself from conviction to
the Democratic party, and steadily since, “through
good and evil report,” he has adhered to and defended
with voice and pen, the interest and doctrines
of that party. He was a senatorial delegate
from Pennsylvania to the Baltimore Convention of
1844, and was the mover of the “two-third rule”
in that Convention, to which fact Mr. Polk unquestionably
owed his nomination. Shortly after the
inauguration, Mr. Polk tendered him, unsolicited,
the judicial appointment of Cherokee Commissioner.
This Mr. Brewster accepted. It was an arduous
and responsible position, requiring great industry and
ability to discharge faithfully. By his course as
Commissioner, he won the esteem and respect of
the suitors, and saved to the government, from the
jaws of rapacious speculators, millions of dollars.
He received at the expiration of the term for which
the office was enacted, the thanks and approval of
the President.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Brewster is a warm supporter of the political
views of Gen. Cass, and is, perhaps, the most
efficient, both with voice and pen, of the many
friends of that distinguished statesman in Pennsylvania.
Differing widely, as we do, from Mr.
Brewster in political sentiment, we can yet bear
testimony to the intrepid conduct of the man, his
high-hearted courage in the cause of his friend, and
his energetic endeavors to secure the ultimate triumph
of General Cass in the next Baltimore Convention.
And although we cannot vote for General
Cass, we can almost wish him success for the sake
of seeing Mr. Brewster’s earnest and manly efforts
crowned with success. If General Cass has many
such friends—and Mr. Brewster’s friendship is of
personal intimacy—he must have qualities that most
politicians deny opponents and rivals, for we are
satisfied that no man can attach to himself <span class='it'>heartily</span>,
any number of men of intellectual force such as
Brewster has, without possessing qualities of head
and heart far above the grade of many aspiring candidates
for the presidency.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Since his retirement from connection with the
administration of Mr. Polk, Mr. Brewster has
been engaged so much in the active pursuits of his
profession as to prevent his giving much of his time
to active politics, though often since by his pen, he
has shown his interest in the great questions that
have been lately agitating the country; and whenever
the interests of General Cass are in jeopardy,
his voice is heard in council, and his pen, lightning-winged,
flies to the rescue.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Having thus hastily glanced at Mr. Brewster’s
position as a lawyer and a public man, and used, as
we confess we have done, the opinions and sentiments
of more than one member of the Philadelphia
bar in high standing, and the unsolicited endorsement
of men high in his party, let us take a closer view
of the man—of his personal character, the proud arch
and basis of the structure, and tell, with all the freedom
of an intimate friend, what we feel we <span class='it'>ought</span> to
say, both in justice to our readers, to give them a
fair view of the man, and to Mr. Brewster, to show
how great have been his achievements against formidable
odds.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Brewster has inherited in an eminent degree
the endurance and high courage of his ancestors.
His path has been a rough one, with an accumulation
of difficulties besetting him on all sides, at the
very threshold of boyhood, which would have prostrated
almost any other man. But he at that early
age made a resolute front, and met and pressed
struggling through all opposition.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He in early life met with an accident, the scars
from which still linger upon his countenance. This,
in the opinion of the timid and ill-advised, was sufficient
for them to urge him into a more quiet and
secluded profession than that of an advocate. But
they little knew, these weak ones, the dauntless
bravery of his soul—the fearless, determined purpose,
the iron will of the man. His motto has been, from
early boyhood, and his life has illustrated it nobly—“There
is nothing unconquerable to him that dares.”
His whole life has been one of struggles, of resolves
and of victories. His manly self-possession under
all disasters, his vehement purpose to overcome, in
spite of fate and circumstances, have given an impetuosity
and daring to his character which enable
him to overleap the impossibilities of other men.
Had he submitted to the dictation of the doubtful,
regarded the counsel of the timid-wise, his lofty soul
would have been dwarfed, his heroic will chafing
for action in seclusion, would have made him a misanthrope—a
pining and peevish companion, a cynic
toward man and a snarler at Providence—the plague
of a household, a weariness unto himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But with the true courage which faces disasters,
the inborn greatness which judges of its own capacity
to endure, with an eye fixed upon the successful
future, which lifts its blazing front to the gaze of true
genius, he spurned all control, and consulting the
inward teachings of his own spirit, he resolved, he
dared and he has triumphed. With a manly heart,
lifted in its gigantic resolves above all mere considerations
of self—obeying all of its generous and noble
impulses, he has from early manhood devoted his
energies to build a paradise around those he loves—to
render his home the abode of all that refines, of
Art, Music and Society—to gather around him those
who appreciated his manhood, and to impart by all
the delicate and tender relations and attentions of a
son and a brother, the largest amount of happiness
which domestic life can afford. With what a royalty
of soul he has done all this, let those answer
who have spent their most delightful hours in his
drawing-rooms—where the stern lawyer, the energetic
champion of political principles and rights has
unbended, and let loose the bounding joyousness of
the man—where his heart has let off its bubbles in
very glee, and where the exhaustless stores of his
memory are poured out in wantonness, and his imagination
and wit flash and play in perfect abandonment.
No man who has not enjoyed his intimacy,
his confidence and his friendship, can make any just
estimate of his ability or worth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As a conversationalist, it has not been our fortune
to meet with many who are his equals, either in the
readiness or the variety of his topics, the fine play
of his fancy, or the mellow flow of his words. There
is not at this bar, a man of his years, who is his
equal in scholarship—who has accumulated so vast a
mass of curious learning. Upon all questions of History,
Philosophy or Biography—he is the referee
among his friends. His accuracy is singularly nice—no
event of which he has read, seems ever to
escape the tenacious grasp of his memory. No quotation
from the Classics, apt at the moment, is ever
wanting to illustrate or point an anecdote or a sentence.
His knowledge of old English literature is
thorough, and his acquaintance with the modern familiar
and full. He is, in all respects a thorough
student—stealing the hours which others devote to
idle pleasure or indolent sleep, to enlarge his stores
of knowledge and make broader and surer the foundations
of intellectual power.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The defect of Mr. Brewster’s character has been
the terrible impetuosity of his impulses, which would
carry him to the gates of Hades in pursuit of a foe,
and through a burning river in support of a friend—frequently,
too, without stopping to ask whether
either was worth the sacrifice. Hence, he has sometimes
become the assailant and the champion, without
the clearest notions as to which side victory
justly belonged. These impulses, too, were as
quick as they were strong. The lightning was not
more sudden than his wrath—nor more certain in its
destructiveness. No man made an enemy of him
and escaped the well-timed blow. But his vengeance
was rarely garnered, but blazed out in a fury which
lent additional terror to the funeral pile of his victim.
His generous sentiments are easily touched.
His time, his talents, his whole soul are given to the
cause of a friend. There is no halfway-house on
the road to his heart—the door is fast shut, or the
whole of the spacious apartments are thrown open,
and the visitor is received amid a blaze of light
from every genial corner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Brewster has recently been abroad, and
travel, which is so often a test of character, has improved
him. He returns from Europe with his
energy of soul held in check—his feelings are composed
and chastened—his manner is subdued to a
more Christian serenity—his voice has not its old,
impetuous volume—the rushing heat of passion
comes from his lips with less of its scorching severity.
Life has broader aims in his eyes than formerly—the
hour and to-day, are less important—the
immediate success less looked to—the distant
future is lived for more earnestly, with wiser hopes
of a happy present hereafter. All this comes upon
us—his old associate—with a force the greater, because
we have been less with him, of late; and the
gradual, familiar growing of these better purposes of
soul have been less visible to us—they burst upon
us like a strain of pure music when discord has suddenly
been stilled. Mr. Brewster, himself, is a happier
man—his old exuberant gayety is a well-tempered
serenity and joyousness—the picture has been
toned down, and the artist dwells upon it as a diviner
effort of the Creator.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Brewster has nothing to do now but to <span class='it'>wait</span>!—high
honors will come to him unsolicited. His
position is assured. His ability, his integrity, his
earnest energy of soul for the right and the true, open
the pathway for all that the ambition of a Christian
has a right to look for. This is Prophecy—the Inspiration
which Truth impresses upon the soul.</p>

<p class='dramaline'>Since my unequal pen essayed to tell</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is not a little extraordinary, that this magnificent
and noble species, which exists in considerable
numbers within two hundred miles of the spot where
I sit writing, in the Adirondack Highlands—I mean,
of New York—which abounds in the north-eastern
part of Maine, swarms in New Brunswick and
Newfoundland, and indeed everywhere North of the
St. Lawrence and Ottawa, to the extremest Arctic
Regions yet penetrated by the foot of man, should
be yet less known to American writers—even on
the topic of Natural History—than most animals of
Central Asia, or the inhospitable wilds of Southern
Africa. It is not even determined—so little care has
been taken in examining or identifying specimens—whether
it is one and the same, or a different species
from the Reindeer of the Europe-Asiatic continent;
nor have any of its peculiarities been noted down,
such as the common indications of its stature, antlers,
pelage, and color, much less its anatomical and
osseous structure, so as to permit of any accurate
comparison being drawn, or decision arrived at.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In proof of the loose way in which these self-styled
descriptions of rare animals are drawn, in books of
solemn pretension and supposed authority, I shall
proceed to quote the following from the Encyclopædia
Americana—a work of which I can only say,
that it is equally profuse of needless information on
subjects trite to every Sophomore, and sparing of
facts, such as require research and are required by
men of ordinary reading, who will search its pages
vainly for what on occasion they may need to
ask it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Reindeer</span>”—says the authority. “These animals
inhabit the Arctic Islands of Spitzbergen, and
the northern extremity of the Old Continent, never
having extended, according to Cuvier, to the southward
of the Baltic. They have been long domesticated,
and their appearance and habits are well described
by naturalists. The American Reindeer, or
Cariboo, are much less generally known; they have,
however, so strong a resemblance to the Lapland
deer, that they have always been considered to be
the same species, though the fact has never been
completely established. The American Indians have
never profited by the docility of this animal, to aid
them in transporting their families and property,
though they annually destroy great numbers for their
flesh and hides. There appear to be several varieties
of this useful quadruped peculiar to the high
northern regions of the American Continent, which
are ably described by Doctor Richardson, one of the
companions of Captain Franklin, in his arduous attempt
to reach the North Pole by land. The closeness
of the hair of the Cariboo, and the lightness of
its skin, when dressed, render it the most appropriate
article for winter clothing in the high latitudes.
The hoofs of the Reindeer are very large, and spread
greatly, and thus enable it to cross the yielding snows
without sinking.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And this—without one word of the height, weight,
color, or habitat of the animal—is the only information
which the Editor of the American Encyclopædia
thinks proper to give his readers—except a brief
description of Doctor Richardson, about whom he
seems to know a little, if he knew nothing about
Cariboo—concerning an animal, which is killed almost
annually within fifty miles of Albany, sold annually
in Montreal, and in New Brunswick and
Nova Scotia almost as common an article as venison,
or Moose-meat during winter in the markets.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Would not any one suppose, on reading the above,
that he was dealing with the description of an animal,
which roamed only wastes untrodden by the
foot of the white man, save the adventurous explorers
of the Arctic Circles, and concerning which
no information can be gained by the ordinary naturalists
of this country?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Cuvier and Richardson, and Audubon’s stupendous
work are not attainable by general readers, or even
ordinary writers of cities; to those of the country
they are utterly inaccessible—but to Encyclopædists,
and to men who sit down to reproduce great works
on Natural History, who choose to consult them,
they are perfectly and easily open; and there is no
shadow of excuse for those who profess to teach
others, yet refuse to learn themselves.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Had the writer of the above worthless trash
thought fit to compare Doctor Richardson’s description
of the Cariboo, which it seems he had read—and
which, like all that singularly able naturalist’s descriptions,
is doubtless as minute as correct—with
Cuvier’s description of the Reindeer, he might have
pronounced as easily, as he could whether two and
two make four or five, whether the American and
Europe-Asiatic deer are identical or different. Godman,
in his “Quadrupeds of North America,” though
a little more definite than Dr. Leiber, is scarce less
bald and brief. Dr. Dekay, whose lamented life has
recently been brought to an untimely close, though
he suspected it to be a denizen of New York, was
not fully assured of the fact, and therefore has not, I
think, described it in his Fauna of that State.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I have myself, unfortunately, no immediate access
to either Richardson or Cuvier; nor even to any
well established work on the Animals of Northern
Europe. But I have seen a large herd, in my youth,
of the Lapland Reindeer, which, with their Esquimaux
attendants were exhibited many years ago in
London; previous to a futile attempt at naturalizing
them in the Highlands and Western Isles of Scotland;
and have a fair, general remembrance of the
animal. I possess antlers of the Cariboo, which
hang in my hall, and which are accurately portrayed
in the wood-cut; I have handled twenty times the
hides of this great deer; and I have daily opportunities—in
the office of my friend, W. T. Porter, of the
Spirit of the Times—to examine the preserved heads
and legs of even finer specimens than my own. I
have also letters, private, and writings published, of
a New Brunswicker, who has killed the Cariboo
fifty times, and had opportunities of seeing the
European Reindeer, at the Zoological Gardens
in London, long since myself. I can, therefore,
form a very fair conjecture at the identity or non-identity
of the species. At least I can give some
particulars of structure, stature, and pelage of the
American Cariboo, which will enable others to judge,
who are better posted up than I, in the peculiarities
of the Lapland Reindeer. And first—I will premise
that although I have never seen the Cariboo in life,
or in his native woods—which I trust to do before
the snows of the next March shall have melted—the
wood-cut illustration of this number is so closely
made up from measurements of the various parts,
heads, antlers, legs and hides of the animal, that I
believe it to be as nearly correct as any likeness can
be, which is not taken from an especial individual
of the race.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the first place—as to the stature of the Cariboo,
I was long ago struck by the statements of the New
Brunswick writer, “<span class='sc'>Meadows</span>,” alias Mr. Barton
Wallop, alluded to above, which may be found in
Porter’s edition of Hawker’s Field Sports, p. 326-333—“The
Cariboo of this country are very like the
Reindeer, only a little larger”—and again—“as this
is the first time you have seen a Cariboo trail, you
will observe it is much like that of an <span class='it'>ox</span>, save that
the cleft is much more open, and the pastern of the
animal being very long and flexible, comes down the
whole length on the snow, and gives the animal additional
support.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Arguing on this statement, in my “Field Sports,”
knowing <span class='sc'>Meadows</span> to have seen both animals, that
they must be distinct, I pointed out—no one could
dream of comparing a Lapland Reindeer’s track to
that of an <span class='it'>ox</span>, any more than to that of an elephant;
and observed further, that the Lapland Reindeer is
not a larger, but—to my recollection—a smaller animal
than the common American Red-deer, <span class='it'>Cervus</span>
<span class='it'>Virginianus</span> of Naturalists. This coming casually
under Mr. Wallop’s eye, he wrote to me, in full confirmation
of my opinion, that he had recently seen
Lapland Reindeer in the Regent’s Park Zoological
Gardens, and wished to amend his former <span class='it'>dictum</span>,
by saying, that the Cariboo is at least one-third taller
than the Lapland deer, and otherwise larger, and in
other respects very different. Also, that the Lapland
animal is not taller than the British Stag, or
the American Common Deer, or, if at all, very
slightly so.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, to come to my own observation, verified by
measurement. The Cariboo antlers in my own
possession, not an unusually large pair, measure as
follows:</p>

<p class='pindent'>Extreme width from tip to tip, one foot 4½ inches.
Length of curvature of antlers, from root to tip, two
feet 3½ inches. Direct height, 23 inches. Breadth
of the palmated brow antlers, 8 inches. Length of
do., 11 inches. Breadth of upper palm, 8 inches.
Length of do., 12 inches. Girth at the root of antler,
5½ inches. At insertion of upper prong, 4
inches. Number of prongs at the tips, unequal—three
and two. At the upper palms, three. On the
lower palms, seven processes, including the principal
point.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Compare with this, the measurements of the antlers
of a very fine specimen of the common American
deer, <span class='it'>Cervus Virginianus</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Extreme width from tip to tip, 11 inches. Length
of curvature along the back of antlers from root to
tip, two feet and half an inch. Direct height, 15
inches.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Observe, however, that the greater curvature in
the horns of the American deer, while it causes a
larger comparative measurement, leaves a vast excess
in height and show to the Cariboo.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the Cariboo, moreover—see cut—the structure
of the horns is directly the reverse of that of any
other palmated-horned animal I ever remember to
have seen; as the Moose, the English Fallow-deer,
and to the best of my recollection the Europe-Asiatic
Reindeer. In both the former of these animals, the
broad palms form the extreme upper tips; while the
lower spurs and brow antlers are round prongs; and,
to the best of my memory, the reindeer has no very
conspicuous palms at all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In our common deer, again, contrary to any other
deer I have ever seen—except a very noble non-descript
specimen recently sent from Calcutta to the
Spirit of the Times—the main branch of the antlers
curves <span class='it'>forward</span> over the brow, offering the main defenses,
the true brow antlers being mere erect
prongs; while all the tines are posterior to the main
branch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the American Elk, and in the British Stag, or
Red-deer, and in all other round-horned deer I ever
saw, the main antlers rise erectly, with a slight
<span class='it'>backward</span> curve, the brow antler and all the other
tines springing from it anteriorly, and forming the
true weapons for the animal’s defense.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Cariboo, therefore, presents a curious combination
of the round-horned and palmated-horned
deer, in the first instance; and of the usual, and
American, round-horn structure, in the second.
First, it has the round, pointed tips and sharp, round
prongs of the round-horned deer above, with the
flat, leaf-like blades of the palmated-horned deer
below. And, secondly, it has the forward curve at
the tips and backward prongs, above, of the American
round-horn, with the terrible brow antlers and
forward tines of the usual structure below.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lastly, it differs from all in this—that its brow
antlers, instead of dividing with an outward curve
over and without each eye, closes with a straight inward
inclination, until the tips almost meet, nearly
in the centre of a brow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Once more, as to size, there are the leg, with
hoof, pastern and cannon-bone of an ordinary sized
Cariboo; and the leg, with hoof, pastern and cannon-bone
of an extraordinarily large-sized American
deer, and as such selected, hanging side by side in
Mr. Porter’s office. The limb of the Cariboo is considerably
more than one-third superior in size to that
of the common deer, and is fully equal to that of a yearling
heifer of the very largest stature, and from its peculiar
structure, being cleft nearly the full length of
the pastern to the fetlock-joint, would evidently leave
a much larger track.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I have seen and ridden aged thorough-bred horses
of fourteen and a half hands—four foot ten inches
high—whose limbs were in all respects inferior to
that of this superb specimen of the deer tribe; and
right confident am I, from observation of several of
their heads, their hides and hoofs, that from fourteen
and a half to fifteen hands will be found to be the
average height of the Cariboo. If the Lapland Reindeer
ever exceeds thirteen it will be surprising to
me. While on this topic, however, I will beg the
first Canadian or Nova Scotian hunter whose eye
this may meet, to furnish me with the full statements
of height, weight and measurement of any
Cariboo he may be so fortunate as to kill, or to have
killed, during the present winter. Readers of Graham
will find in the February number of the present
year a correct and spirited representation of the antlers
of the English red-deer; and, if they will look
back to the June and August numbers of 1851, they
will find those of the moose and American deer,
designed by myself from the life, which will far
more easily convey the comparison which I desire
to draw than written words.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As regards the nature of the pelage, or fur, for it is
almost such, of the Cariboo, so far from its being, as
the wiseacre of the Encyclopædia states, remarkable
for closeness and compactness, it is by all odds the
loosest and longest haired of any deer I ever saw;
being, particularly about the head and neck, so
shaggy as to appear almost maned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In color, it is the most grizzly of deer, and though
comparatively dark brown on the back, the hide is
generally speaking light, almost dun colored, and on
the head and neck fulvous, or tawny gray, largely
mixed with white hairs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The flesh is said to be delicious; and the leather
made by the Indians from its skin, by their peculiar
process, is of unsurpassed excellence for leggings,
moccasons or the like; especially for the moccason to
be used under snow-shoes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As to its habits, while the Lapland or Siberian
Reindeer is the tamest and most docile of its genus,
the American Cariboo is the fiercest, fleetest, wildest,
shyest and most untameable. So much so, that
they are rarely pursued by white hunters, or shot
by them, except through casual good-fortune; Indians
alone having the patience and instinctive craft,
which enables them to crawl on them unseen, unsmelt—for
the nose of the Cariboo can detect the
smallest taint upon the air of any thing human at
least two miles up wind of him—and unsuspected.
If he take alarm and start off on the run, no one
dreams of pursuing. As well pursue the wind, of
which no man knoweth whence it cometh or whither
it goeth. Snow-shoes against him alone avail nothing,
for propped up on the broad, natural snow-shoes of his
long, elastic pasterns and wide-cleft clacking hoofs,
he shoots over the thinnest crust, over the deepest
drifts, unbroken; in which the lordly moose would
soon flounder, shoulder-deep, if hard pressed, and the
graceful deer would fall despairing, and bleat in vain
for mercy—but he, the ship of the winter wilderness,
outspeeds the wind among his native pines and tamaracks—even
as the desert ship, the dromedary,
outtrots the red simoom on the terrible Zahara—and
once started, may be seen no more by human eyes,
nor run down by fleetest feet of man, no, not if they
pursue him from their nightly-casual camps, unwearied,
following his trail by the day, by the week,
by the month, till a fresh snow efface his tracks, and
leave the hunter at the last, as he was at the first of
the chase; less only the fatigue, the disappointment
and the folly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Therefore by woodsmen, whether white or red-skinned,
he is never followed. Indians by hundreds
in the provinces, and many loggers and hunters in
the Eastern states, can take and keep his trail in suitable
weather—the best <span class='it'>time</span> is the latter end of
February or the beginning of March; the best
<span class='it'>weather</span> is when a light, fresh snow of some three or
four inches has fallen on the top of deep drifts and a
solid crust; the fresh snow giving the means of following
the trail; the firm crust yielding a support to
the broad snow-shoes and enabling the stalkers to
trail with silence and celerity combined. Then they
crawl onward, breathless and voiceless, up wind
always, following the foot-prints of the wandering,
pasturing, wantoning deer; judging by signs, unmistakable
to the veteran hunter, undistinguishable to
the novice, of the distance or proximity of their
game; until they steal upon the herd unsuspected,
and either finish the day with a sure shot and a
triumphant whoop; or discover that the game has
taken alarm and started on the jump, and so give it
up in despair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One man perhaps in a thousand can still-hunt, or
stalk, Cariboo in the summer season. He, when
he has discovered a herd feeding <span class='it'>up wind</span>, at a
leisurely pace and clearly unalarmed, stations a comrade
in close ambush, well down wind and to leeward
of their upward track, and then himself, after closely
observing their mood, motions and line of course,
strikes off in a wide circle well to leeward, until he
has got a mile or two ahead of the herd, when very
slowly and guardedly, observing the profoundest
silence, he cuts across their direction, and gives
them his wind, as it is technically termed, dead
ahead. This is the crisis of the affair; if he give
the wind too strongly, or too rashly, if he make the
slightest noise or motion, they scatter in an instant,
and away. If he give it slightly, gradually, and
casually as it were, not fancying themselves pursued,
they merely turn away from the remote danger,
and instead of flying, merely <span class='it'>feed</span> away from it,
working their way <span class='it'>down wind</span> to the deadly ambush,
of which their keenest scent cannot so inform
them. If he succeed in this, inch by inch, he crawls
after them, never pressing them, or drawing in upon
them, but preserving the same distance still, still
giving them the same wind as at the first, so that he
creates no panic or confusion, until at length, when
close upon the hidden peril, his sudden whoop sends
them headlong down the deceitful breeze upon the
treacherous rifle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of all wood-craft none is so difficult, none requires
so rare a combination as this, of quickness of sight,
wariness of tread, very instinct of the craft, and perfection
of judgment. When resorted to, and performed
to the very admiration of woodmen, it does
not succeed once in a hundred times—therefore not
by one man in a thousand is it ever resorted to at all,
and by him, rather in the wantonness of wood-craft,
and by way of boastful experiment, than with any
hope, much less expectation of success.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For once, in my illustration, the trick has been
played, and the game wins—the whoop is pealing
on the wind beyond the dark, sheltering pines and
hemlocks—the herd is scattered to the four winds
of heaven—but the monarch of the wilderness, the
prime bull of the herd, bears down in his headlong
terror full on the ambushed rifle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lo! with how brave a bound he clears that prostrate
log. But the keen eye of the woodman is
upon him; another moment, and it shall glare along
the deadly rifle; the sharp, short crack shall awake
the echoes of the forest, and ere they shall have
subsided into silence, the pride of the woods shall
have gasped out his last sigh on the gory green-sward.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But this you will say is fancy—scarcely fact. Be
it so. What follows shall be fact, not fancy. For
I shall beg leave to quote a few pages from Porter’s
Hawker by that “Meadows,” whom I have already
mentioned—since his is the best description of this
noble sport extant; since to reproduce it, giving his
thoughts in my own altered words were rankest
plagiary; and since, if it meet his eye, he will be
rather pleased than hurt that I have winged his
words into a wider field and to a larger audience
than he at first addressed them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I will premise only, that “Howard,” who figures
as the hero, is a New Brunswicker, in New Brunswick;
“Meadows,” the narrator, an English tyro
visiting his friend in the province; Sabatisie, a Micmac
Indian, henchman and guide of Meadows; and
Billy, last not least, Howard’s pet bull terrier.
Scene, daybreak! they have issued from the camp
close to the hunting-ground where the Cariboo are
supposed to “won”—as Chaucer would have written
it—when lo! quoth Meadows—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“After a hearty meal, every thing being ready,
we <span class='it'>mounted</span> our snow-shoes and marched. The
first golden rays were just struggling through the
gray East, and dispersing the thick mist which hung
over our camp, as I strode forth on my first Cariboo
hunt, my heart leaping in anxious anticipation, and
my nerves strung by the healthy atmosphere. We
proceeded in silence, and had ample time to observe
the lonely grandeur of the surrounding forest; the
death-like stillness enlivened only by the cheerful
chirp of the active ground-squirrel, or the loud boring
of that most beautiful of woodpeckers, the Hid. We
crossed Cariboo tracks at every step, but still the
Indian proceeded, his quick eye glancing at every
trail. After about an hour’s walk, we found ourselves
ascending a steep mountain. Here the Indian
came to a halt: in a low tone he told us that we
were now near the Cariboo ground, this being the
warm side of the hill, and good feeding ground;
cautioning us to be quiet, we again advanced, but
had not gone far before we came to a trail that the
Indian said was only made last night. Sabatisie
chose the outside track of the herd, to take the wind—which,
having followed about three miles, brought
us to where the Cariboo had rested during the night.
Tom placed his hand on the damp snow, and remarked
that the Cariboo had not been up much before
us, and could not be far off.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Rifles were now examined, and fresh caps put
on—Billy secured by a cord to Howard’s belt. The
tracks from the resting-place of the Cariboo branched
off in every direction; and the Indian leaving us,
took a <span class='it'>cast</span> round, some distance, and having ascertained
the direction the herd had taken, he returned,
and we cautiously followed him. I now perceived
that at the bottom of the tracks the snow was a deep
blue, and quite soft; we were therefore quite near
the game. Sabatisie halted and took off his snow-shoes
that he might proceed with less noise. Howard
beckoned me to him, and in a low whisper said—‘Do
exactly as you see me do—follow close upon my
track, and do not for your life make the slightest
noise—we are close on them!’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sabatisie and Howard now slung their snow-shoes
on their backs: to prevent the crackling of
the crust, the Indian with his fingers broke the snow
before him, and placing his foot in the hole he made,
quietly advanced—Howard putting his in the track
the Indian had left, I mine in Howard’s. By this
means we proceeded without the slightest noise; and
as our movements were simultaneous, we should to
a person in front appear as one body. Our situations
were certainly any thing but agreeable, up to
the waist in snow. The trail became every moment
more fresh, and the eagle eye of our sagacious
guide pried far into the depths of the forest in front.
Suddenly he cast himself at full length on the snow,
and remained so long in that position that I innocently
thrust my head out of the line to see what
was the matter; but the Indian glared at me with
anger and contempt, and Howard’s sign recalled my
senses. In front, the wood being quite open, Sabatisie
had seen the Cariboo, and now made for a large
pine to shelter his approach. His movements, as he
dragged himself along on his belly in the snow, were
snake-like; and we followed, endeavoring as far as
possible to imitate his very <span class='it'>interesting contortions</span>.
At last I caught sight of the game. They were a
large herd of 18 or 20—some rubbing the bark from
the branches—others performing their morning toilet,
licking their dark-brown, glossy jackets, and combing
them with their noble antlers. All appeared unconscious
of the approach of their most deadly foes, save
one noble bull, the leader of the herd. He seemed suspicious—with
head erect, eyes darting in every direction,
ears wagging to and fro, and nostril expanded,
he snuffed the breeze. Upon this splendid creature
the Indian kept his eye, never venturing to move
save when the head of the Cariboo was turned away.
Inch by inch we approached the tree. Oh! the
agony of suspense I suffered in those few minutes!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At length we reached our shelter. No time was
lost. Howard signed to me to single out a Cariboo,
while he took the noble leader, which was about
100 yards distant—the Indian reserving his fire. We
stationed ourselves each side of the tree, and our rifles
exploded almost at the same moment. Springing up
to see the effect of my shot, I was pulled down by
the Indian; what was my astonishment to see the
bull Howard had fired at, stamping the snow, and
gazing around, with fire and rage in his eye, in search
of his hidden enemy. As I looked at his formidable
antlers, his majestic height, and great strength—a
thought of our helpless situation crossed my mind.
The Indian now rested his gun quietly on the tree,
and took a long, steady aim—the cap alone exploded
with a sharp crack! Quick as lightning the bull
discovered our ambush, and with a loud snort made
directly for us. Defense or retreat against such a
foe, in our situation, up to the waist in snow, was
almost impossible. In another bound the antlers of
the enraged beast would have been in my side, when
our gallant little dog dashed forward and seized the
bull by the muzzle. Sabatisie and Howard were
busily employed putting on their snow-shoes; and
I endeavored to do the same, but with little success.
The dog had luckily checked the beast, but he was
no match for the enormous strength and wonderful
activity of his adversary. Tossing his head, the
Cariboo beat the poor little fellow on the snow and
against the tree, till I thought every bone was
broken. Finding this of no avail, the bull reared,
and with his fore-legs dealt such a shower of quick
and powerful blows, that I expected to see the dog
drop every minute. While the Cariboo was in this
position, the Indian approached him behind and endeavored
to hamstring him. But the eye of the bull
was too quick; wheeling like lightning, he made a
rush at Sabatisie, which must have been serious,
but was avoided by his falling flat on his face, the
Cariboo passing over him and wounding his back.
Meanwhile Howard had loaded, but his rifle having
become wet, he could not discharge it. The violent
exertions of the Cariboo had by this time broke the
hold of the dog, and the furious beast now turned
to the prostrate Indian—but before he could reach
his prey, the dog was again at his head, checking,
but not stopping his mad career. Sabatisie on his
knee received the shock, and at the moment grasping
the bull by the antlers, brought him down; when
Howard sprang forward and plunged his knife to
the hilt in the breast of the Cariboo. With a last
mighty effort, the noble creature dashed the Indian
in the air, and the next moment his own strong
limbs were quivering in death.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“From the commencement of this burst, I confess,
I was a little agitated—so much so, that I had not
coolness sufficient to tie on my snow-shoes, or load
my rifle; but let not any blame me until they themselves
have had the pleasure of being placed in the
same delicate situation, up to the waist in snow, and
one of those emperors of the deer tribe dancing round
in mad fury, threatening instant annihilation. On
examination, we found Howard’s ball had taken effect
just behind the shoulder, and would have caused
death in a short time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Hillo! old boy, are you hurt?’ said Tom Howard,
seeing the Indian still on his back.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Cariboo <span class='it'>sartain bery strong</span>,’ grunted the poor
fellow. His back was much lacerated. ‘Brother
cut some gum, and soon be well,’ said Sabatisie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Howard gathered some balsam formed by the sap
running from the bark of the fir-tree, and spreading
it on a piece of his handkerchief, formed a strong adhesive
plaster—staunching the blood, he placed it on
the wound.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘And now, Meadows, what has become of your
game—think he is hit?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Yes, by Jove, I’ll bet my rifle to a pop-gun he
is—for see, Billy has settled down on his track, and
is in chase.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘On with your snow-shoes, and away!—the
track with the blood will be plain as a van wagon—if
you come up with the Cariboo, do not fire unless
you are sure to kill. I must stop and see if the Indian
is much hurt, and swab out my rifle—but I will
soon overtake you—away now!’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So urged, I started off, and found large drops of
blood on the track the prime little dog had taken.
As I proceeded, I saw the strides of the Cariboo were
shorter, and he had been down several times. As I
pressed on, in great hopes of overtaking the game
before Howard came up, I observed the Cariboo had
made for the valley, and after a sharp walk of an
hour, I came to the stream, which was open. Here
I lost the track, but saw the marks of the dog down
the stream—these I followed, and soon heard the
baying of the dog. As I proceeded, the river was
every moment more rapid. After a sharp turn the
stream was compressed between two huge cliffs,
and rushed down a water-gap, forming a cascade of
nearly one hundred feet. To the very verge of the
fall the river was open; but over the fall itself there
was a thin coating of transparent ice, which clung
to the perpendicular cliffs on each side of the narrow
gap, forming a gauze-like veil. The towering cliffs
around were covered with a frosting of ice; and
from the stunted pines which clung to the barren
rock, hung myriads of fantastic icicles. At the foot
of the fall, the blue water rushed out, dashing the
white foam many feet in the air; and through the
thick woods which overhung the cascade, the sun
cast his rays upon the gorgeous prospect, making
every object throw forth a thousand brilliant shades,
and the glittering ice which encircled the fall was so
transparent, that the blue water could be seen beneath
dashing furiously down, as if enraged at restraint.
Not ten feet from the verge of the fall, on
a rock in the centre of the river, stood the wounded
Cariboo. The water around him was fearfully rapid—one
false step would carry him under the ice, and
down the fall. On the bank stood the dog: my first
care was to secure him, as he appeared ready every
instant to make a spring that must have been fatal.
The Cariboo had chosen a most admirable place of
retreat; nothing living could approach him with
safety. On each side the perpendicular cliffs towered
many feet over his head—before him the roaring
torrent, and behind the ice-bound cataract. After
feasting my eyes on this wild and romantic scene, I
approached as near the fall as the rugged cliff would
permit. The Cariboo saw me, and with glaring eye-balls
he shook his branching antlers in impotent rage,
presenting to my rifle his broad front, as in defiance.
I am not ashamed to say I was happy when I glanced
at the rapid water and rugged cliff between me and
my devoted prey; for I have no doubt, had it been
in his power he would have soon shortened the distance
between us—and after what I had so lately
witnessed, I had no very great desire (seeing I was
not as yet a perfect harlequin on snow-shoes,) to play
the same game over again with my friend on the
rock. To put an end to his wishes and my fears, I
presented. My ball took effect directly in his brain,
and he quietly dropped into the stream, leaving me
master of the <span class='it'>field</span>. The next moment I could see,
through the transparent ice, his glossy hide gliding
down the cascade.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Amiable reader, thus it was that “Meadows”
slew his first Cariboo; and thus, pray for me, that I
may kill mine, this very month. If I do, believe me,
I will try to tell you how I did it, as well—better I
may not tell you—as Meadows. And so, until next
month, fare you well!</p>

<div><h1><a id='was'></a>WAS THE WORLD MADE OUT OF NOTHING?</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>The idea of creation may be symbolically represented
under a variety of images: under that of the
evolution of numbers from an original unity; that of
the eradiation of light from an original light; or that
of an expression of syllables and tones, answered for
aught we know to the contrary, <span class='it'>by an echo</span>. The
Hebrews seem to have preferred this last symbol.
“In the beginning God <span class='it'>created</span> (Heb. <span style='font-size:smaller'>BARA</span>, <span class='it'>brought
forth</span>) the heavens and the earth.” In the verb
<span class='it'>bara</span>, the meaning <span class='it'>create</span> and <span class='it'>cry</span> are identified: for
this reason, it is eminently adapted to denote a creation
capable of being symbolically represented by a
vocal utterance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The primary sense of <span class='it'>create</span> and <span class='it'>cry</span>”—says
Noah Webster, and we are careful to adduce in this
place the testimony of a man whom no one will
suppose to have been led astray by ontological
speculations—“is the same, to throw, to drive out,
to bring forth, precisely as in the Shemitic <span style='font-size:smaller'>BARA</span>.”
The Hebrew text may indeed be correctly but inadequately
rendered: “In the beginning God <span class='it'>bore</span>
(or <span class='it'>bare</span>, preserving in the English word the radical
letters of the original <span style='font-size:smaller'>BARA</span>) the heavens and the
earth.” For the same lexicographer says in another
place, “The verb <span class='it'>to bear</span>, I suppose to be
radically the same as the Shemitic <span style='font-size:smaller'>BARA</span>, to produce:
the primary sense is, to throw out, to bring
forth, to thrust, to drive along.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The author of the epistle to the Hebrews says:
“By faith we understand that the worlds were
framed by the word of God, so that things which are
seen were not made of things which do appear.”
These things which <span class='it'>do not appear</span> are real existences;
for the apostle says, “the things which are
seen are temporal, but the things that are unseen
(that is, which do not appear,) are eternal.” The
text therefore does not affirm that the worlds were
made out of nothing, but implies, on the contrary,
that they were framed out of invisible (that is, virtual
or potential) things. Plato says: “Let us lay
down two classes of being, the seen and the unseen;
the unseen, eternal in their relations; the seen, never
the same but ever changing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A cause which creates from nothing as material
on which to operate, must of necessity itself stand
as substance to its own creature: in such a case, the
creator and the creature must be consubstantial.
The dogma therefore that the worlds are created
absolutely out of nothing, is <span class='it'>Pantheism</span>. The
statement that the worlds are created out of nothing
is not found in Scripture, neither is it possible that
it should be found there; for the idea is absurd in
itself, since out of nothing, nothing can come, and a
universe absolutely created out of nothing would be
a mere prolongation of Supreme Power; and moreover,
there is no Hebrew word, nor known collocation
of Hebrew words, capable of expressing such an absolute
creation. The verb <span style='font-size:smaller'>BARA</span>, as we have seen,
signifies something quite different.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fabre d’Olivet, who has endeavored to reconstruct
the Hebrew language from its biliteral roots, translates
the passage, “The earth was without <span class='it'>form and
void</span> (Heb. <span class='it'>tho-hu va bo-hu</span>)” as follows: “The
earth was a contingent potentiality of being, and in
a potentiality of being.” He affirms that the term
<span class='it'>hu</span> is derived from <span class='it'>hua</span> (<span class='it'>being</span>, that which <span class='it'>is</span>,) and
that it is formed of <span class='it'>h</span>, the letter of life, taken in connection
with one of the signs of manifestation. The
signs of manifestation are these, <span class='it'>i</span>, <span class='it'>o</span>, <span class='it'>u</span>, and are used
in this way: <span class='it'>u</span> represents latent or virtual manifestation,
<span class='it'>i</span> represents the passage from potentiality
into actuality, <span class='it'>o</span> represents manifestation in its intensity
and actual realization. Thus <span class='it'>hu</span>, in tho-hu
va bo-hu, is latent or virtual being, while <span class='it'>ho</span>, in Jehovah,
is Being in the fullness of actual existence.
The blinding of the vowel in <span class='it'>ho</span>, which gives <span class='it'>hu</span>,
represents the retrocession of being from the fullness
of actuality into mere invisibility or potentiality;
while on the contrary, the opening of the vowel in
<span class='it'>hu</span>, that is, the changing of <span class='it'>hu</span> into <span class='it'>ho</span>, represents
the opposite process, or the procession of being from
potentiality into actuality. This same root appears
again in the same verse in the word <span class='it'>thehom</span>, translated
in our version by the term “deep.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Hebrew cosmogony is more scientific than
that of India. The Hindoos tell us that the universe
exists in two states, that it is sometimes visible and
sometimes invisible; but they do not tell us by what
process things come forth from the <span class='it'>thehom</span> or
“deep,” and return again into the same. But in the
Hebrew cosmogony all that is explained. According
to the Hebrews, things are in this “deep” when they
are not related to each other; and they come forth
from this “deep” by coming into relations with
each other. According to the Hebrews, things have
no power in themselves to come into relations with
each other, that is, to emerge from this “deep,” but
must be brought into such relations by the Divine
Energy: so it is the putting forth of the Divine
Energy which causes this universe to appear, and
the withdrawing of that Energy which causes it to
disappear again. This may be illustrated. In order
to the possibility of an act of vision, it is necessary
not only that there should be some person capable
of seeing and some object capable of being seen, but
also that the light requisite in order that these two
may be brought into relations should exist. Who
can see in the dark? So long as there is no light,
the seer and the seen exist to each other potentially
only: but as soon as the light shines these two become
related.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the Hebrew Scriptures, the Divine Powers,
which bring finite existences into relations with each
other, thus causing them to emerge from the <span class='it'>thehom</span>,
or “deep,” are called—<span class='it'>the Spirit of God</span>. “Darkness
was on the face of the deep, and the Spirit of
God moved on the face of the waters.” This Divine
Spirit, operating upon man in its ordinary measure,
makes man to be what he is; operating beyond its
ordinary measure, it becomes especial <span class='it'>inspiration</span>.
The Hebrews supposed this universe would continue
in visible existence so long as the Spirit of God
should breath upon it, but that it would fall back
into the <span class='it'>the-hom</span> the moment that spirit should withdraw
its vivifying power.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We read in the speech of Elihu, reported in the
book of Job:—</p>

<p class='pindent'>Draw the curtains, stir the fire, make a semicircle
round the rug, and now for a <span class='it'>causerie</span>. Mary Russell
Mitford shall talk to us out of the three volumes
of reminiscences she has just given to the world;
and whatever we have to say about the sundry things
she discourseth upon therein shall be said in a cordial,
and, at the same time, perfectly frank spirit, as
becometh an honest fireside.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There she sits in the large chair, not quite so
young as she was when she charmed all homesteads
and hearth-stones with pictures of her own quiet
Berkshire village, before railroads came to destroy
the pretty wayside inns, where travelers used to be
so snug and comfortable in tiny carpeted rooms with
dimity curtains and glass cupboards full of antediluvian
china: when little Red-riding-hoods were
as plenty as blackberries, and the gipsies were never
at a loss for secluded nooks and dells, where they
could camp and cook, and tell stories under the
hedge-rows, with a feeling of solitude and security
they can never enjoy again in merry England. That
was a long, long time ago; yet Mary Russell Mitford
looks as ready as she was in her brightest days to
enter with a relishing zest into the garden delights
and book pleasures that have formed the occupation
and happiness of her life, and made her name known
and welcome wherever natural description and unaffected
feeling are truly appreciated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There she sits, with as homely and good-humored
an air as if, instead of writing books and holding correspondence
with half the celebrities of her time, she
had no other vocation in this world than to attend to
domestic affairs, prune shrubs on the lawn, dispense
flannels at Christmas to the poor, and look after a
neighboring school. Beside her chair stands her
constant companion, a remarkable stick, with an odd
sort of a head to it; and to make her actual presence
the more palpable she should be surrounded by her
inseparable friends—Fanchon, her little dog, that
might be crouched at her feet, with its sensitive ears
lifting and falling at every sound; her neat maid,
Nancy, watching her on a low stool, and her boy,
Henry—(we hope he is still a boy,) and that he will
contrive, for her sake, to continue so—standing behind
her chair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That stick has a biography all to itself, and a very
curious one it is. Sixty years ago it was a stick of
quality, and belonged to some Dowager Duchess of
Athol, who has no more reality for us than one of the
embroidered ladies in an old piece of tapestry. So
far as its original owner is concerned, the stick, for
aught we know to the contrary, may be a phantom-stick,
or a witch-stick; but, be that as it may, Miss
Mitford’s father bought it at the sale of Berkshire
House, where it was huddled by the auctioneer into
a lot of old umbrellas, watering-pots, and flower-stands.
It was then light, straight, and slender,
nearly four feet high, polished, veined, and of a yellowish
color, and of the order called a crook, such,
says Miss Mitford, who is evidently very particular
about it, as may be seen upon a chimney-piece figuring
in the hand of some trim shepherdess of Dresden
china. First, the housekeeper carried this stick—then,
when the housekeeper died, Miss Mitford’s
mother took possession of it; and from her it descended
to Miss Mitford, herself, who, first out of
whim, and afterward from habit and necessity, made
it her trusty supporter on all occasions. The adventures
of that stick are as full of perils and hair-breadth
escapes as ever befell a South Sea whaler, or a Hudson’s
bay trapper. Once it was lost in a fair, once
forgotten in a marquee at a cricket match, and at another
time stolen by a little boy, which cost its mistress
a ten miles walk for its recovery. But the
worst calamity that befell it was, when in the act of
drawing down a rich branch of woodbine from the
top of a hedge, its ivory crook came off, falling into
a muddy ditch, and sinking so irretrievably that it
was never recovered. The crook, it seems, was
very handsome, and was bound with a silver rim,
imparting a lady-like appearance to the stick, which
at the first sight, gave you a hint of its aristocratic
origin. In this extremity it was sent to a parasol
shop to have a new crook put on, but the stupid people
first docked many inches of its height, and
then put on a bone umbrella-top, that fell off of its
own accord in a few days. A good-natured friend
remedied the second loss by fastening on an ebony
top, which looks, after four or five years’ wear,
a little graver, “and more fit for the poor old mistress,
who having at first taken to a staff in sport, is
now so lame as to be unable to walk without one.”
The memoirs of a walking-stick may strike our
readers as a mere waste of words and paper; but it
is surprising what slight incidents rise into importance
and interest in a country life, and how much
the reality of its portraiture is indebted to trivial, but
by no means unessential features. At all events,
Miss Mitford’s stick is a stick of note, and should no
more be passed over in silence than the ruff of
Queen Elizabeth, or the flowing ringlets of Congreve.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Mitford’s life seems to have opened upon her
in that page of the old quarto edition of “Percy’s
Reliques,” where the ballad of the “Children in the
Wood” is to be found. It is the first book, almost
the first event she remembers. They used to put
her upon a table before she was three years old,
when she was, as she says, only a sort of twin-sister
to her own doll, to make her read leading articles
out of the morning papers; and the reward for this
terrible penance was to hear her mother recite the
“Children in the Wood,” just as children are rewarded
for taking nauseous things by a promise of a
lump of sugar. At last, she got possession of the
volumes themselves, and made acquaintance with
the rest of the ballads, which possess as great a
charm for her now as they did then; and she never
looks upon the old books—the very same edition Dr.
Johnson used to treat with a very learned and unwise
superciliousness—that the days of her childhood,
or doll-hood, do not come vividly back upon
her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She still keeps to the Percy collection. She does
not seem to care about the lore that has been dug up
since, or the antiquarian research that has come to
the illustration of our old English poetry. Even the
first edition contents her—she will have no other—she
has an affection for it—it is enough for her purpose—it
recalls the happy time when its pages disclosed
a new world of enchantments to her—and she
holds it in reverence amongst her literary penates.
There is nothing in her reminiscences to show that
she troubles herself about Percy societies, or Shakspeare
societies, that she has ever dipped into
Notes and Queries, or would think herself obliged to
the officious critic who should detect a flaw in her
two precious quarto volumes. The faith and the
enthusiasm of childhood still cling to the well-known
book, and would be very much put out by being disturbed
at their devotions. And this is the character
of Miss Mitford’s mind. She would rather believe
in an old tradition than have it dispelled by the detective
police that go about exploring chronicles and
ferreting out damaging facts. She thinks a pleasant
delusion better than a disagreeable truth; and it is
to this fondness for old books, and old places, and the
old stories that have grown up into a popular creed
about them, that we may trace the paramount charm
of simplicity and trustfulness, the cheerful spirit and
the teeming good-nature which abound in her
writings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To us, we must acknowledge, this freshness of
the heart and entire freedom of the imagination, is
very delightful. Miss Mitford is not a critic; but
she is something a great deal better and more agreeable.
She is of too enjoyable a temperament for a
critic; she has not a tinge of the malice or perversity
of criticism in her genial nature. For this reason,
her opinions are sometimes slightly heterodox, but it
is always on the side of a good-will, and a hearty
admiration of some gracious or gentle quality which
she has been at the pains to discover, and which few
people would take the trouble to look for. She
speaks rapturously of Davis’ “Life of Curran;”
has such innocent rural views of literature, that she
thinks nobody reads Pope and Dryden now, and that
George Darley is unknown as a poet to the English
public; detects a close resemblance between the
Irish novels of Banim and the romanticist creations
of Victor Hugo, Sue, Dumas, and the rest of that
school; thinks that few works are better worth
reading than Moncton Milnes’ “Life of Keats,” not
only for the sake of Keats, but of his “generous
benefactors, Sir James Clarke and Mr. Severn;”
regrets that certain works have fallen into oblivion,
from which no effort of fashionable or literary patronage
can redeem them; considers Willis, Lowell
and Poe the great American poets; and hopes that
Richardson’s novels and Walpole’s letters will never
come to an end. Nobody’s judgment can suffer any
damage from such amiable notions; and the world
is always sure to derive benefit from the kindly spirit
that overlooks a hundred defects and follies for the
sake of a single virtue it finds hidden beneath them.
We wish there were more Miss Mitfords, with her
intellect, to set us so influential an example of toleration
and a willingness to be pleased.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She confesses that she was a spoilt child, and that
papa spoilt her. It is evident, from what we have
just said, that sudden and high as was the growth
of her reputation, the public have not spoilt her.
What the applause of critics and the admiration of
her readers failed to do, papa did. “Not content
with spoiling me in-doors, he spoilt me out. How
well I remember his carrying me round the orchard
on his shoulder, holding fast my little three-year-old
feet, whilst the little hands hung on to his pig-tail,
which I called my bridle—those were days of pig-tails—hung
so fast, and lugged so heartily, that sometimes
the ribbon would come off between my fingers,
and send his hair floating, and the powder flying
down his back.” The papa who thus made her first
acquainted with the orchard, occupies a still more
prominent space in her subsequent reminiscences.
From him to whom she was indebted for her early
love of nature, and the happy hours of childhood, she
also derived the heaviest sorrow of her life. The
story is strange and melancholy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A young physician, clever, handsome, gay, in a
small town in Hampshire, Miss Mitford’s father won
the hand of an heiress with a property of eight-and-twenty
thousand pounds. With the exception of
two hundred a year, settled on her as pin-money, the
whole of this fortune was injudiciously placed at the
free use of Dr. Mitford, who seems to have possessed
every quality to make his wife happy—except prudence.
Being an eager Whig, he plunged into election
politics and made enemies; being very hospitable,
he spent more money than he could afford;
and, endeavoring to retrieve the waste by cards and
speculation, he sank nearly the whole of his resources.
In this extremity, he thought he would do
better in a fresh place, and so the family removed to
Lyme Regis, where they had a fine house, which
twenty years before had been rented by the great
Lord Chatham for the use of his sons. Here they
led a very gay life for two or three seasons—balls,
excursions, dinners; yet in the midst of it, Miss Mitford
says, she felt a secret conviction that something
was wrong—“such a foreshowing as makes the
quicksilver in the barometer sink while the weather
is still bright and clear.” Her father went ominously
to London, and lost more money—she does not say
how—all was now gone except the pin-money:
friends departed one by one, and there was great
hurry and confusion, and then everything was to be
parted with, and everybody to be paid, and the family
made a forced journey to London, part of which was
performed in a tilted cart without springs, for lack
of better conveyance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Settled in a dingy, comfortless lodging in one of
the suburbs beyond Westminster Bridge, Dr. Mitford’s
constitutional vivacity returned. He used to take
his little girl, then ten years old, in his hand about
town to show her the sights; and one day they
stopped at an Irish lottery-office, and showing her
certain mysterious bits of paper with numbers on
them, he desired her to choose one. She selected
No. 2,224; but as this was only a quarter, and papa
wanted to purchase a whole ticket, he desired her to
choose again. But her heart was set on No. 2,224,
because the numbers added together made up ten,
and that day happened to be her tenth birth-day.
Fortunately, the lottery-office man had the whole
number in shares, and so the ticket was bought.
She must relate the sequel in her own words.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>“The whole affair was a secret between us, and my
father, whenever he got me to himself, talked over our
future twenty thousand pounds, just like Almaschar over
his basket of eggs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Meanwhile time passed on, and one Sunday morning
we were all preparing to go to church, when a face that
I had forgotten, but my father had not, made its appearance.
It was the clerk of the lottery-office. An express
had just arrived from Dublin, announcing that No. 2,224
had drawn a prize of twenty thousand pounds, and he
had hastened to communicate the good news.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, me! in less than twenty years what was left of
the produce of the ticket so strangely chosen? What?
except the Wedgwood dinner service that my father had
had made to commemorate the event, with the Irish harp
within the border on one side, and his family crest on the
other. That fragile and perishable ware long outlasted
the more perishable money!”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Mitford relates these painful recollections
with a serenity and patience that yield a lesson from
which her readers may profit as largely as from the
example of extravagance and recklessness which
made so severe a demand on her feelings and her
philosophy; and it is pleasant, after all her vicissitudes
and jolting over the rough ways of the world,
to find her in a tranquil cottage, in the midst of the
scenery she loves, with her dog and her maid, her
stick and her pony, enjoying as much felicity as can
be reasonably looked for in the sunset of a chequered
life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Scattered over the volumes without much heed of
chronology or sequence, are many little personal
scraps that will hereafter enter into her biography,
from the light which they throw upon the cast and
color of her training. The papa, who was so indifferent
to money, who was addicted to such ruinous
habits, and who in his general relations with society,
seems to have sacrificed the comfort and repose of
his home, was, nevertheless, the most devoted of
fathers. From her earliest childhood to the last hour
of his life, he treated her with an affectionate and
caressing tenderness that, in spite of his manifest
errors, leaves an amiable impression of his character
behind. One of the incidents on which she dwells
with the greatest satisfaction was her first visit to
London; and the mode of it is not only illustrative
of the comparatively primitive habits of the time,
but of the simplicity of the man in his domestic life.
Having occasion to come to London in the middle of
July, he suddenly announced his intention of taking
her up with him in his gig; and at this open fashion
they started, stopping to dine at Crauford Bridge in a
little inn—then a very famous posting-house—whose
pretty garden and Portugal laurels she still remembers;
and then on to Hatchett’s Hotel in Piccadilly,
where she stood looking out of the window and wondering
when the crowd would go by; and in the
evening she was so unconscious of fatigue from this
exciting journey that papa took her to the Haymarket
to see a comedy—one of the comedies, she says,
that George III. used to enjoy so heartily, although
what sort of comedy it was we know not, unless,
which we shrewdly suspect, it was a specimen of
Colman the Younger, or of the Morton and Reynolds
school. She had seen plays before in a barn—but
never such a play as this. The whole description
of this trip to London is as good in its way as anything
Fielding himself could have done.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dear papa,” in the pride of his heart, insisted
upon making an accomplished musician of her, and
would “stick her up” to the piano, although she had
neither ear, taste, nor application. Her master was
Hook, the father of the facetious Theodore, and she
was taught in the schoolroom where Miss Landon
passed the greater part of her life. Luckily they
shut her up in a room to make her practise the harp,
and as it was full of books she fell to reading, and
under these auspicious circumstances made her first
acquaintance with the plays of Voltaire and Molière.
She was caught in the fact of laughing till the tears
ran down her cheeks over that passage in the “Bourgeois
Gentilhomme,” where the angry father apostrophises
the galley, “Que diable alloit-il faire dans
cette galère!” As her good stars had it, she was
detected in her delinquency by the husband of the
schoolmistress, who happened to be a Frenchman,
an adorer of Molière, and a hater of music, and who,
instead of chiding her for her neglect of the instrument,
dismissed the harp-mistress, and made the
young student a present of a cheap edition of Molière,
for her own reading, which she has to this
hour, in twelve unbound, foreign-looking, little volumes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After these scenes, we find her in a cottage, at
Taplow—at this time a grown-up lady—looking over
a garden of honeysuckles, lilies, and roses, making
excursions to Windsor, to Gray’s Lawn at Stoke
Poges, to Burke’s at Beaconsfield, and to the College
at Chalfont, where Milton found a refuge during the
plague. We always associate Miss Mitford with
cottages. We cannot imagine her living in a slated
house, three stories high, with a carriage sweep,
and steps up to the door—we cannot suffer her in our
imagination to have any of the comforts and solidity
of a well-built mansion about her; it must be a cottage,
with its ivy creepers, its portico and latticed
windows, and everything round it looking as green
and rural as a wilderness of trees and shrubs, growing
up luxuriantly in a warm, languid climate can
make it. In short, we must smother her in flowers,
or she is not the Miss Mitford that we know so well
in the pastoral books she has written.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Turning from the autobiographical passages which
form so interesting a part of these volumes, there are a
variety of literary sketches of an equally attractive
kind. Miss Mitford runs over a wide field of books
and recollections; and from her extensive acquaintance
with literary people, and the desultory character
of her reading, she supplies an abundant store of
anecdote and remark.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The following is new, and certainly very curious.
The scene is an old, wooden, picturesque house, at
Cambridge, in America, once the head quarters of
Washington, but now the residence of Longfellow,
the poet.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>“One night the poet chanced to look out of his window,
and saw by the vague starlight a figure riding
slowly past the mansion. The face could not be distinguished;
but the tall, erect person, the cocked hat, the
traditional costume, the often-described white horse, all
were present. Slowly he paced before the house, and
then returned, and then again passed by, after which,
neither horse nor rider were seen or heard of.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>Miss Mitford does not give us any authority for this
anecdote; but the collectors of ghost stories are not
very particular about authorities, and will be content
to take it upon her own, as we do.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There is a sketch of Elizabeth Barrett, and a little
biography attached to it, which will be read with
interest. Miss Mitford’s acquaintance with her commenced
fifteen years ago.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>“Of a slight, delicate figure, with a shower of dark
curls falling on either side of a most expressive face
large, tender eyes richly fringed by dark eye-lashes, a
smile like a sunbeam, and such a look of youthfulness,
that I had some difficulty in persuading a friend, in whose
carriage we went together to Chiswick, that the translator
of the ‘Prometheus of Æschylus,’ the authoress of
the ‘Essay on Mind,’ was old enough to be introduced
into company, or, in technical language, was <span class='it'>out</span>.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>It was in the following year that Miss Barrett
broke a blood-vessel in the lungs, which consigned
her to a long illness, during which she lost a favorite
brother by one of those melancholy accidents which
leave ineffaceable memories in the hearts of the survivors.
He was drowned, with two companions, in
sight of her windows at Torquay, whither she was
ordered for change of air. This tragedy nearly killed
her; and more than a year afterward, when she was
removed to London by easy journeys, she told Miss
Mitford that, “during that whole winter, the sound
of the waves rang in her ears like the moans of one
dying.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>William Cobbett was one of the notabilities to
whom Miss Mitford was introduced by her father,
whose intimacy with him was brought about through
their mutual attachment to field sports. She describes
him in his own house as a man of unfailing good
humor and great heartiness; tall, stout and athletic,
with a bright smile, and an air compounded of the
soldier and the farmer, to which his habitual red
waistcoat contributed not a little. His activity was
something to be remembered, for he would begin the
day by mowing his own lawn, a laborious pastime
in which he beat his gardener, who was esteemed,
except himself, the best mower in the parish.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Upon one occasion, Dr. Mitford and his daughter
were invited to Cobbett’s to meet the wife and
daughters of a certain Dr. Blamire; and as it appeared
that Dr. Mitford had formerly flirted with
Mrs. Blamire, some amusement was expected from
seeing how they would meet after a lapse of twenty
years, both of them having shaken off the old <span class='it'>liaison</span>,
and married in the meanwhile.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>“The most diverting part of this scene, very amusing
to a bystander, was, that my father, the only real culprit,
was the only person who throughout maintained the appearance
and demeanor of the most unconscious innocence.
He complimented Mrs. Blamire on her daughters—two
very fine girls—inquired after his old friend, the
doctor, and laughed and talked over by-gone stories with
the one lady, just as if he had not jilted her, and played
the kind and attentive husband to the other, just as if he
had never in all his days made love to anybody except
his own dear wife.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Formerly, we frequently met with physicians who
belonged to this class, and who were indebted for
their professional success mainly to their social tactics
and invincible pleasantry; but although you still
occasionally fall in with a medical man who considers
it as necessary to cultivate popularity amongst
ladies as to attend to the practice of his art, the age
of the flirt-physicians, we are happy to believe, has
passed away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Mitford’s literary “recollections” bear rather
more upon books than upon the authors of them.
The book-gossip to which she invites us, traverses
a considerable round of poets, novelists, and miscellaneous
writers, and the specimens of their works
over which she lingers with delight, make a body of
extracts which enhance the value and variety of the
publication. Her notes upon these selected passages
discover a geniality and earnestness which will be
grateful even to the reader who may sometimes have
occasion to think that her praise is a little in excess,
or who may doubt the judgment that has been shown
in particular selections.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This tendency to a good-natured estimate of her
favorite authors, shows itself most conspicuously in
her admiration of certain poets, whose merits the
world has not hitherto rated so highly. We are not
sorry, nevertheless, to meet snatches of such people
as Mr. Spencer and Miss Catharine Fanshawe—whose
chief claim to notice is, that she was the
author of the Enigma on the letter H, which used
to be ascribed to Byron—for, except through the
flattering medium of books like these, we are not
very likely to see the <span class='it'>vers de société</span> that were in
such request some fifty years ago, disinterred for our
special delectation. They are abundantly curious,
and discover a certain verbal facility and gayety of
the thinnest and airiest kind, which will at least
amuse, if not instruct the reader, by setting him
thinking of the extinct modes and tastes to which
they were addressed, and out of which they extracted
their fugitive popularity. But poetasters of this
order, however cheerfully and successfully they help
to shed a grace on private life, and to give a sort of
intellectual vivacity to social intercourse, can never
be made to survive their hour in print. They must
perish with the occasion that gave them birth; and
you might as well hope to procure for the acted
charade, if it were taken down in short-hand and
published, the same success in the closet that it received
on its impromptu delivery, as to procure for
the graceful trifles thrown off for the amusement of
a <span class='it'>coterie</span>, the honors of a permanent place in the
library. They never aimed at such a destiny, and can
never achieve it; and it may be doubted whether
their fragile existence should be risked in print at
all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of all the neglected, forgotten, or unknown books
Miss Mitford has brought to life again, the Autobiography
of Holcroft is the most deserving of resuscitation.
We know no memoir of its kind—excepting
the only one forbidden book in French literature—that
possesses its charm of frankness, truthfulness
of detail, and quiet development of character. Unfortunately
it is nothing more than a fragment, consisting
of seventeen chapters, dictated by Holcroft—a
prolific author and translator—in his last illness;
stopping short at an interesting point in his career,
and furnishing such evidences of clear-sighted judgment,
and happy skill in relation and portraiture, as
to leave an indelible regret upon the mind of the
reader at finding himself cast upon the grander diction
of Hazlitt for the continuation of the narrative. The
contrast is painful. The brilliancy and paradoxical
genius of Hazlitt, rendered him of all men the most
unfit to follow up the unpretending strength and simplicity
of Holcroft; and the transition is something like
being transported from the fresh air and pastoral beauty
of a natural landscape into a severe Italian garden.
There was but one point in common between them—and
that was the most contracted and least characteristic
of all—their agreement in politics. Holcroft
was a man of larger powers, and a wider range of
tastes than might be predicated from that party martyrdom
which gave him so distressing a notoriety in
the latter days of his life, to the partial eclipse of his
literary reputation. But the subject is not likely to
be revived now, nor would it repay the labors of a
more competent editor. Miss Mitford, however, has
done well in drawing attention to Holcroft’s book,
and the extracts she has given from it will be read
with interest; but it is only from the memoir itself,
as a whole, tracing the course of the self-educated
boy from his origin upward, that an adequate notion
can be formed of the enthralling charm of that singular
narrative.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We have exceeded our limits. A gossip, intended
to occupy only five minutes or so, has already run
over the brim of the measure which we proposed to
fill up to the health of Miss Mitford. It is not the
first time she has tempted us into an excess of this
kind; but, if the reader will open her volumes over
the fireside as we have done, we are mistaken if he
do not find quite as much difficulty as we do now in
shutting them up and putting them down again.</p>

old lover. The General was a fine example of the
well-preserved person and manners of the past century;
beauty always recognizes beauty as a distinguished
relative; and Isabel turned her head, to
render it as attractive as it could be.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The General smiled, and after gazing for another
minute with evident pleasure, he said—“Do me the
favor to keep that attitude, and walk across the
room.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Isabella did so with much dignity; she certainly
was exceedingly handsome;—her step light, but
firm; her figure, admirably poised; her head, well and
gracefully placed; her features, finely formed; her
eyes and smile, bright and confiding. She would
have been more captivating had her dress been less
studied; her taste was evidently Parisien rather than
classic. The gentleman muttered something, in
which the words, “charming,” and “to be regretted,”
only met her ear; then he spoke distinctly:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You solicited my candor, young lady—you challenged
comparison between you and your compeers,
and the passing belles whom I have seen. Now, be so
kind as to walk out of the room, re-enter, and curtsey.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Had Isabel Montford been an uneducated young
lady, she might have flounced out of the <span class='it'>salon</span>, in obedience
to her displeasure, which was very decided;
but as it was, she drew herself to her full height, and
swept through the folding-doors. The General took
a very large pinch of snuff. “That is so perfectly a
copy of her poor aunt!” he murmured;—“just so
would she pass onward, like a ruffled swan; she went
after that exact fashion into the ante-room, when she
refused me, for the fourth time, thirty-five years
ago.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The young Isabel re-entered, and curtseyed. The
gentleman seated himself, leaned his clasped hands
upon the head of his beautiful inlaid cane—which he
carried rather for show than use—and said, “Young
lady, you look a divinity! Your <span class='it'>tourneure</span> is perfection;
but your curtsey is frightful! A dip, a bob, a
bend, a shuffle, a slide, a canter—neither dignified,
graceful, nor self-possessed! A curtsey is in grace
what an <span class='it'>adagio</span> is in music;—only masters of the art
can execute either the one or the other. Why, the
beauty of the Duchess of Devonshire could not have
saved her reputation as a graceful woman, if she had
dared such a curtsey as that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I assure you, sir,” remonstrated the offended
Isabel, “that Madame Micheau——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do I care for the woman!” exclaimed the
General, indignantly. “Have I not memory?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can you not teach me?” said Isabel, amused
and interested by his earnestness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I teach you!—I! No; the curtseys which
captivated thousands in my youth were more an inspiration
than an art. The very queen of <span class='it'>ballet</span>, in
the present day, cannot curtsey.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Could my aunt?” inquired Isabel, a little saucily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your aunt, Miss Montford, was grace itself. Ah!
there are no such women now a-days!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And, after the not very flattering observation, the
General moved to the piano. Isabel’s brows contracted
and her cheeks flushed; however, she glanced
at the looking-glass, was comforted, and smiled. He
raised the cover, placed the seat with the grave gallantry
of an old courtier, and invited the young lady
to play. She obeyed, to do her justice, with prompt
politeness; she was not without hope that <span class='it'>there</span>, at
least, the old gentleman would confess she was
triumphant. Her white hands, gemmed with jewels,
flew over the keys like winged seraphs; they bewildered
the eye by the rapidity of their movements.
The instrument thundered, but the thunder was so
continuous that <span class='it'>there was no echo</span>! “The contrast
will come by-and-by,” thought the disciple of the old
school—“there must be some shadow to throw up
the lights.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thunder—crash—thunder—crash—drum—rattle—a
confused, though eloquent, running backward and
forward of sounds, the rings flashing like lightning!
Another crash—louder—a great deal of crossing
hands—violent strides from one end of the instrument
to the other—prodigious displays of strength on
the part of the fair performer—a terrific shake!
“What desperate exertion!” thought the General;
“and all to produce a soulless noise.” Then followed
a fearful banditti of octaves—another crash,
louder and more prolonged than the rest; and she
looked up with a triumphant smile—a smile conveying
the same idea as the pause of an opera-dancer
after a most wonderful <span class='it'>pirouette</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you keep a tuner in the house, my dear young
lady?” inquired the General.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If a look could have annihilated, he would have
crumbled into ashes; but he only returned it with
admiration, thinking, “How astonishingly like her
aunt, when she refused me the second time!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And that is fashionable music, Miss Montford?
I have lived so long out of England, only hearing the
music of Beethoven, and Mozart, and Mendelssohn,
I was not aware that noise was substituted for power,
and that execution had banished expression. Dear
me!—why, the piano is vibrating at this moment!
Poor thing! How long does a piano last you, Miss
Montford?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Isabel was losing her temper, when fortunately
her aunt—still Miss Vere—came to the rescue. The
lovers of thirty years past, would have met any
where else as strangers. The once rounded and
queen-like form of the elder Isabel was shorn of its
grace and beauty; of all her attributes, of all her attractions,
dignity only remained; and it was that
high-bred, innate dignity which can never be acquired,
and is never forgotten. She had not lost the
eighth of an inch of her height, and her gray hair
was braided in full folds over her fair but wrinkled
brow. Isabel Montford looked so exactly what
Isabel Vere had been, that General Gordon was
sorely perplexed; Isabel Vere, if truth must be told,
had taken extra pains with her dress; her niece had
met the General the night before, and her likeness to
her aunt had so recalled the past, that his promised
visit to his old sweetheart (as he still called her)
had fluttered and agitated her more than she thought
it possible an interview with <span class='it'>any man</span> could do; she
quarreled with her beautiful gray hair, she cast off
her black velvet dress disdainfully, and put on a blue
<span class='it'>Moire antique</span>. (She remembered how much the
Captain—no, the <span class='sc'>General</span>, once admired blue.) She
was not a coquette; even gray hair at fifty-five does
not cure coquetry where it has existed in all its
strength; but, for the sake of her dear niece, she
wished to look as well as possible. She wondered
why she had so often refused “poor Gordon.” She
had been all her life of too delicate a mind to be a
husband-hunter, too well satisfied with her position
to calculate how it could be improved, and yet, she
did not hesitate to confess to herself that now, in the
commencement of old age, however verdant it might
be, she would have been happier, of more consequence,
of more value, as a married woman. She
had too much good sense, and good taste, to belong
to the class of discontented females, consisting of
husbandless and childless women, who seek to establish
laws at war with the laws of the Almighty;
so, if her heart did beat a little stiffly, and sundry
passages passed through her brain in connection with
her old adorer, and what the future might be—she
may be forgiven, and will be, by those not strong-minded
women who understand enough of the waywardness
of human nature to know that, if <span class='it'>young</span>
heads and <span class='it'>old</span> hearts are sometimes found together,
so are young hearts and old heads. The young laugh
to scorn the idea of Cupid and a crutch, but Cupid
has strange vagaries, and at any moment can barb
his crutch with the point of an arrow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The old people,” as Isabel Montford irreverently
called them that evening, did not get on well together;
they were in a great degree disappointed one
with the other. They stood up to dance the <span class='it'>minuet
de la cour</span>, and Isabel Vere languished and swam as
she had never done before; but the General only
wondered how stiff she had grown, and hoped that
he was not as ill used by time as Mistress Isabel
Vere had been. At first, Isabel Montford thought it
“good fun” to see the antiquities bowing and curtseying,
but she became interested in the lingering
courtliness of the little scene, trembled lest her aunt
should appear ridiculous, and then wondered how
she could have refused such a man as General Gordon
must have been.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Days and weeks flew fast; the General became a
constant visitor in the square, and the heart of Isabel
Vere had never beaten so loudly at twenty as it did
at fifty-and-five; nothing, she thought, could be more
natural than that the General should recall the days
of his youth, and seek the friendship and companionship
of her who had never married, while he—faithless
man!—had been guilty of two wives during his
“services in India.” It was impossible to tell which
of the ladies he treated with the most attention.
Isabel Montford took an especial delight in tormenting
him, and he was cynical enough towards her at
times. Although he frankly abused her piano-forte-playing,
yet he evidently preferred it to the music
Miss Vere practised so indefatigably to please him,
or to the songs she sang, in a voice which from a high
“soprano,” had been crushed by time into what might
be considered a very singular “mezzo.” He somehow
forgot how to find fault with Miss Montford’s
dancing, and more than once became her partner in
a quadrille. It was evident, that while the General
was growing young, Miss Vere remained—“as she
was!” Isabel Montford amused herself at his expense,
but he did not—quick-sighted and man-of-the-world
though he was—perceive it. At first he was
remarkably fond of recalling and dating events, and
dwelling upon the grace, and beauty, and interest,
and advantage, of whatever was past and gone—much
to the occasional pain of Isabel Vere, who, gentle-hearted
as she was, would have consigned <span class='it'>dates</span> to
the bottomless pit; latterly, however, he talked a
good deal more of the present than of the past, and,
greatly to the annoyance of younger men, fell into the
duties of escort to both ladies,—accompanying them
to places of public promenade and amusement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On such occasions, Miss Isabel Vere looked either
earnest or bashful—yes, positively bashful; and Miss
Isabel Montford, brimful of as much mischief as a
lady could delight in. At times, the General laid
aside his cynical observations, together with his
cane, which was not even replaced by an umbrella;
to confess the truth, he had experienced several
symptoms of <span class='it'>heart disease</span>, which, though they
made him restless and uncomfortable, brought hopes
and aspirations of life, rather than fears of death.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One morning, Isabel Montford and the General were
alone in the <span class='it'>salon</span> where this little scene first opened:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Our difference has never been settled yet,” she
exclaimed, gaily; “you have never proved to me the
superiority of the Old school over the New.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Simply because of your superiority to both,” he
replied.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do not perceive the point of the answer,” said
the young lady. “What has my superiority over
<span class='it'>both</span> to do with the question?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The General arose and shut the door. “Do you
think you could listen to me seriously for five minutes?”
he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Listening is always serious work,” she answered.
He took her hand within his; she felt it was the hand
of age; the bones and sinews pressed on her soft palm
with an earnest pressure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Isabel Montford—could you love an old man?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She raised her eyes to his, and wondered at the
light which filled them:—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” she answered, “I could love an old man
dearly; I could confide to him the dearest secret of
my heart.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And your heart, your heart itself? Such things
have been, sweet Isabel.” His hand was <span class='it'>very</span> hard,
but she did not withdraw hers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, not <span class='it'>that</span>, because—because I have not my
heart to give.” She spoke rapidly, and with emotion.
“I have it not to give, and I have so longed to tell
you my secret! You have such influence with my
aunt, you have been so affectionate, so like a father
to me, that if you would only intercede with <span class='it'>her</span>, for
<span style='font-size:smaller'>HIM</span> and me, I know she could not refuse. I have
often——often thought of entreating this, and now it
was so kind of you to ask, if I could love an old man,
giving me the opportunity of showing that I do, by
confiding in you, and asking your intercession.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The room became misty to the General’s eyes, and
the rattle of a battle-field sounded in his ears, and
beat upon his heart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And pray, Miss Montford,” he said, after a pause,
“who may <span class='it'>him</span> be?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, <span class='it'>you</span> do not know him!—my aunt forbade
the continuance of our acquaintance the day before I
had the happiness to meet you. It was most fortunate
I wooed you to call upon her, thinking—” (she
looked up at his fine face, whose very wrinkles were
aristocratic, and smiled her most bewitching smile)
“thinking the presence of the only man she ever
loved would soften her, and hoping that I should one
day be privileged to address you as my friend, my
uncle!” And she kissed his hand.—It really was
hard to bear. “I have heard her say,” persisted the
young lady, “that when prompted by evil counsel,
she refused you, she loved you, and since your return
she only lives in your presence.” The General
wondered if this was true, and thought he would not
give the young beauty a triumph. He was recovering
his self-possession. “I remembered your admiration
of <span class='it'>passing belles</span>, and felt how kindly you
tolerated me, <span class='it'>for my aunt’s sake</span>; and surely you
will aid me in a matter upon which my happiness,
and the happiness of that poor dear fellow depends?”
She bent her beautiful eyes on the ground.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And who is the poor dear fellow?” inquired the
General, in a singularly husky voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Henry Mandeville,” half-whispered Isabel. “Oh,
is it not a beautiful name? the initials on those lovely
handkerchiefs you gave me will still do; I shall still
be I. M.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A son of old Admiral Mandeville’s?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The <span class='it'>youngest</span> son,” she sighed, “that is my
aunt’s objection; were he the <span class='it'>eldest</span>, she would have
been too happy. Oh, sir, he is such a fine fellow—such
a hero!—lost a leg at Cabool, and received I
don’t know how many stabs from those horrid
<a id='aff'></a>Affgauns.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lost a leg!” repeated the General, with an approving
glance at his own; “why he can never
dance with you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, but he can admire my dancing, and does not
think my curtsey a dip, a shuffle, a bend, a bob, a
slide, a canter! Ah! dear General, I was always
perfection in his eyes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By the immortal duke,” thought the General,
“the young divinity is laughing at me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My aunt only objects to his want of money;
now I have abundance for both; and your recommendation,
dear sir, at the Horse Guards, would at
once place him in some position of honor and of
profit; and even if it were abroad, I could leave my
dear aunt with the consciousness that her happiness
is secured by you, dear, guardian angel that you are.
Ah! sir, at your time of life you can have no idea
of our feelings.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh yes, I have!” sighed the General.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bless you!” she exclaimed enthusiastically; “I
thought you would recall the days of your youth and
feel for us; and when you see my dear Harry”—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“With a cork leg”—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ay, or with two cork legs—you will I know be
convinced that my happiness is as secure as your
own.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Women are riddles, one and all!” said the General,
“and I should have known that before.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! do not say such cruel things and disappoint
me, depending as I have been on your kindness and
affection. Hark!” she continued, “I hear my aunt’s
footstep: now dear, <span class='it'>dear</span> General, reason coolly with
her—my very existence depends on it. If you only
knew him! Promise, do promise, that you will use
your influence, all-powerful as it is, to save my life.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She raised her beautiful eyes, swimming in unshed
tears, to his; she called him her uncle, her dear noble-hearted
friend; she rested her snowy hand lovingly,
imploringly on his shoulder, and even murmured
a hope that, her aunt’s consent once gained, it
might not be impossible to have the two weddings
<span class='it'>on the same day</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The General may have dreaded the banter of sundry
members of the “Senior United Service Club,”
who had already jested much at his devotion to the
two Isabels; he <span class='it'>may</span> have felt a generous desire to
make two young people happy, and his good sense
doubtless suggested that sixty-five and seventeen bear
a strong affinity to January and May; he certainly
did himself honor, by adopting the interests of a brave
young officer as his own, and avoided the banter of
“the club,” by pledging his thrice-told vows to his
“old love,” the same bright morning that his “new
love” gave her heart and hand to Henry Mandeville.</p>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>The Works of Shakspeare: the Text Carefully Restored
According to the First Editions; With Introductions,
Notes, Original and Selected, and a Life of the Poet.
By the Rev. H. N. Hudson, A. M. In Eleven Volumes.
Boston: James Monroe &amp; Co. Vol. 3.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>This beautiful edition of Shakspeare, a fac-simile of
the celebrated Chiswick edition in type and paper, has
now reached its third volume. It is edited by Mr.
Hudson, well known all over the country as one of the
most accomplished of Shakspeare’s critics and commentators,
and who in his present labors has far surpassed
the reputation he obtained by his lectures on the same
subject. The present volume contains The Merchant of
Venice, As You Like It, All’s Well that Ends Well,
and The Taming of the Shrew. The text is very carefully
revised, and the notes are clear, short, and full of
matter, and flash the meaning of obscure phrases, remote
allusions, and other difficulties of the text, at once upon
the reader’s mind, without any parade of learning or
paradox of interpretation. It is, however, in the introductory
notices to the plays that the analytical and interpretative
genius of the editor shines forth most resplendently.
Every lover of Shakspeare should possess
this edition, had it nothing to recommend it but these
alone. They give the results of meditations, alike penetrating
and profound, on the interior processes of Shakspeare’s
mind in creating character and in forming plots;
and the marvel of his genius, in its depth, delicacy, comprehension,
fertility, and sweetness, is developed with
the austerity of science and the geniality of a sympathizing
spirit. These introductions are not only thus
critical, but they include in a short space a large amount
of antiquarian knowledge respecting the bibliography
and sources of the plays; and the old tales which suggested
or formed the basis of the plots, are re-told with
much skill and simplicity of narration.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The masterpiece of the present volume is the introduction
to The Merchant of Venice. It is exceedingly
brilliant in style, but the brilliancy seems to come from
an inward heat and fervor generated by an intense contemplation
of the subject, so that the diction sparkles,
as Ben Jonson would say, “like salt in fire.” The
brilliancies are flashes, not of fancy, but of thought;
and frequently are the result of vigorous condensation
in statement, or of logic which gets on fire by the very
rapidity of its movement. The finest elements of the
style, however, are its subtleties of statement and representation,
subtleties which follow the most intricate
windings and enfoldings of complex thought, speeding
on the fire track of an ideal allusion to the very limits
of its course, and thoroughly mastering all the obstacles
of expression in giving form to the most evanescent workings
of the creative power.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus in speaking of the apparent heterogeneousness
but real unity of the play, he remarks: “The persons
naturally fall into three several groups, with each its
several plot and action; yet the three are most skillfully
complotted, each standing out clear and distinct in its
place, yet concurring with the others in dramatic unity,
so that every thing helps on every other thing, without
either the slightest confusion or the slightest appearance
of care to avoid it. Of these three groups it is hardly
necessary to add that Antonio, Shylock and Portia are
the respective centres; while the part of Lorenzo and
Jessica, though strictly an episode, seems, nevertheless,
to grow forth as an element of the original germ, <span class='it'>a sort
of inherent superfluity</span>, and as such essential, not indeed
to the being, but to the well-being of the work; in short,
a fine romantic undertone accompaniment to the other
parts, yet contemplated and provided for in the whole
plan and structure of the piece; <span class='it'>itself</span> in harmony with
all the rest, and therefore perfecting their harmony with
one another.” We will put it to the consciousness of
every reader of Shakspeare if this does not chime with
his feeling of the matter; but to show the grounds of
this instinctive taste, and exhibit it in its intellectual
form, and justify it by the austerest principles of philosophical
criticism, requires Mr. Hudson’s sharpness of
eye and ready refinements of expression. The specimen
we have given, as it is not the best which might be
selected, so is it a very common and unobtrusive characteristic
of his criticism.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In commenting on the characters of the play, Mr.
Hudson displays more than ordinary keenness and discrimination.
We are acquainted with no student of
Shakspeare who could read the analysis of Shylock,
Antonio, Portia and Jessica, without receiving an addition
to his knowledge. Even Launcelot Gobbo has
his share of the critic’s acumen; his necessity, in the
organism of the piece, is demonstrated; and the exquisite
<span class='it'>non-sequiturism</span> of his whole personality is finely
described. “A mixture, indeed, of conceit and drollery,
and hugely wrapped up in self, yet he is by no means a
commonplace buffoon, but stands firm and secure in the
sufficiency of his original stock. His elaborate nonsense,
his grasping at a pun without catching it, yet feeling
just as grand as if he did, is both ludicrous and natural;
his jokes, to be sure, are mostly failures; nevertheless
they are laughable, because he dreams not but that they
succeed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is needless to say that the prominent feature in Mr.
Hudson’s criticism is Shylock. The combination in him
of the individual and the national, Shylock the Jew and
the Jew Shylock, is indicated with a bold, firm hand.
One paragraph is especially powerful. “Shylock,” he
says, “is a true representative of his nation; wherein
we have a pride which for ages never ceased to provoke
hostility, but which no hostility could ever subdue;
a thrift which still invited rapacity, but which no rapacity
could ever exhaust; and a weakness, which,
while it exposed the subjects to wrong, only deepened
their hate, because it left them without the means or the
hope of redress. Thus Shylock is a type of national
sufferings, sympathies, and antipathies. Himself an
object of bitter insult and scorn to those about him; surrounded
by enemies whom he is too proud to conciliate
and too weak to oppose; he can have no life among them
but money; no hold upon them but interest; no indemnity
out of them but revenge. Such being the case, what
wonder that the elements of national greatness became
congealed or petrified into malignity? As avarice was
the passion in which he mainly lived, of course, the
Christian virtues which thwarted this were the greatest
wrong that could be done him. With these strong
national traits are interwoven personal traits equally
strong. Thoroughly and intensely Jewish, he is not
more a Jew than he is Shylock. In his hard, icy intellectuality,
and his ‘dry, mummy-like tenacity’ of purpose,
with a dash now and then of biting sarcastic humor,
we see the remains of a great and noble nature, out
of which all the genial sap of humanity has been pressed
by accumulated injuries. With as much elasticity of
mind as stiffness of neck, every step he takes but the last
is as firm as the earth he treads upon. Nothing can
daunt, nothing disconcert him; remonstrance cannot
move, ridicule cannot touch, obloquy cannot exasperate
him; when he has not provoked, he has been forced to
bear them; and now that he does provoke them, he is
proof against them. In a word, he may be broken; he
cannot be bent.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>We cannot refrain from picking out a sentence, here
and there, in the critic’s admirable delineation of Portia.
“Eminently practical in her tastes and turn of mind,
full of native, home-bred sense and virtue, she unites
therewith something of the ripeness and dignity of a
sage, a rich, mellow eloquence, and a large, noble discourse,
the whole being tempered with the best grace
and sensibility of womanhood.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Nothing can be more
fitting and well-placed than her demeanor, now bracing
her speech with grave maxims of moral and practical
wisdom, now unbending her mind in playful sallies of
wit, or innocent, roguish banter.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. It is no drawback
upon Portia’s strength and substantial dignity of character,
that her nature is all overflowing with romance;
rather, this it is that glorifies her and breathes enchantment
about her; it adds that precious seeing to the eye
which conducts her to such winning beauty and sweetness
of deportment, and makes her the ‘rich-souled’
creature that Schlegel describes her to be.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The introductions to All’s Well that Ends Well, and
The Taming of the Shrew, are replete with shrewd remark
and acute analysis, but both are inferior to the
criticism of As You Like It. The woodland sweetness
of this play tasks all the subtlety and all the enthusiasm
of Mr. Hudson to do it justice. An exquisite ideal
beauty casts its sweet and satisfying charm over the
whole of this matchless comedy, and we envy Shakspeare’s
delight in its composition more than Campbell
envied his happiness in bodying forth A Midsummer Night’s
Dream. Even Le Beau, the courtier of Frederic,
is an ideal courtier; on inborn gentlemanliness, of the
finest kind, stealing out from him in performing his most
ungracious duties. This character is commonly performed
on the stage by the worst actor the manager has
in his company, but we have always noticed that the
feeblest performer became lifted into dignity by simply
pronouncing one golden sentence in the first act. It is

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Hudson says very acutely of the characters of As
You Like It, that, “diverted by fortune from all their
cherished plans and purposes, they pass before us in just
that <span class='it'>moral and intellectual dishabille</span>, which best reveals
their indwelling graces of heart and mind.” This, it
seems to us, touches the inmost secret of the delight all
mankind have in this play. There is a complete absence
of restraint upon expression, and the tongues of all run
of their own sweet will, in a region of perfect freedom.
It is whim exalted into poetry. Of Touchstone, our
critic remarks, that though he never touches so deep a
chord as the poor fool in Lear, that “he is the most entertaining
of Shakspeare’s privileged characters.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. It
is curious to observe how the poet takes care to let us
know from the first, that beneath the affectations of his
calling some precious sentiments have been kept alive;
that far within the fool <span class='it'>there is a secret reserve of the man</span>,
ready to leap forth and combine with better influences as
soon as the incrustations of art are thawed and broken
up.” Passing over some keen observations on Jaques
and the class of character to which he belongs, we come
to Mr. Hudson’s exquisite description of Rosalind, the
style of which would alone tempt one to extract it. The
ideal merriment of Rosalind—and after listening to her
for an hour, it seems a misuse of the word merriment to
apply it to glee less graceful, light and lark-like than her
own—has rarely been touched with so delicate an analysis.
“For wit,” he says, “this strange, queer, lovely
being is fully equal, perhaps superior to Beatrice, yet
nowise resembling her. A soft, subtle, nimble essence,
consisting in one knows not what, ‘and springing up
one can hardly tell how,’ her wit neither stings nor
burns, but plays briskly and airily over all things
within its reach, enriching and adorning them, insomuch
that one could ask no greater pleasure than to be the
continual theme of it. In its irrepressible vivacity it
waits not for occasion, but runs on forever, and we wish
it to run on forever: we have a sort of faith that her
dreams are made of cunning, quirkish, graceful fancies.
And her heart seems a perennial fountain of affectionate
cheerfulness; no trial can break, no sorrow chill her
flow of spirits; even her deepest sighs are breathed forth
in a wrappage of innocent mirth; an arch, roguish
smile irradiates her saddest tears. Yet beneath all her
playfulness we feel that there is a firm basis of thought
and womanly dignity, so that she never laughs away
our respect.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>An edition of Shakspeare, edited so admirably as this—so
convenient in its form, so elegant in its execution,
and so cheap in its price—will, we hope, have a circulation
over the country corresponding to its great
merits.</p>

Collection of Home Poems. By Caroline A. Briggs.
Boston: Phillips, Sampson &amp; Co. 1 vol. 12mo.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Our first impression of this volume we received from
its title, and that impression was, of course, unfavorable,
as the title certainly smacks of affectation. But
it requires but a slight examination of the book to dissipate
such a prejudice. It is a thoroughly genuine expression
of a sensitive, thoughtful, artless, affectionate,
and fanciful nature, and readily wins its way into the
reader’s esteem. Even those passages which evince a
sort of innocent ignorance of the conventions of society
and letters, have a <span class='it'>naïveté</span> which charms while it
amuses. The volume is a collection of short poems,
ranged under the general titles of Voices of Affection,
Voices of Grief, Voices of Cheer, Sacred Voices, and
Voices of the Way, and one powerful Voice for the
Poor, written in a measure whose movement has something
of the fitful swiftness of the cold, wild wind,
whose cruelty it deprecates. The following lines convey
a vivid picture of desolation; the verse itself seeming to
shudder in sympathy with the objects it holds up to
pity:</p>

<p class='pindent'>When we say that there is in this volume some poems
that an austere taste would have omitted, we merely say
what we suspect is the truth, that the poetess is young,
and that this is her first introduction to the public.
We might object to a piece, here and there, that the
feeling outruns the thought and fancy, and that commonplace
lines occasionally glide stealthily in to meet the
demands of the rhyme; but the faults which criticism
might exhibit are few in comparison with the merits
which shine forth of their own light on almost every
page. The general impression which the whole book
leaves on the memory is very pleasing. The defect
of all young poets, that of expansiveness, is continually
apparent; but it is a natural result of the movement
of a nature so full of sensibility that it refuses to submit
to the restraints of condensation, but pours itself
out of its own sweet will. As a natural result of this
extreme sensitiveness, the volume is comparatively destitute
of those electric flashes of impassioned imagination,
which come, swift, sure, and smiling from moods
of the mind in which thought is condensed as well as
animated by passion; but it still exhibits so genial a love
of nature, a flow of feeling so kindly and sympathetic,
so much beauty, and purity and sweetness of fancy, and
withal so much richness of promise, and such a ready
yielding of the mind to the poetical aspects of things,
that we trust it will meet with the success due to its
native excellencies of heart and brain.</p>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>The Snow-Image, and other Twice-Told Tales. By Nathaniel
Hawthorne. Boston: Ticknor, Reed &amp; Fields.
1 vol. 16mo.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>This is a collection of Mr. Hawthorne’s Sketches and
Stories which have not been included in any previous
collection, and comprise his earliest and latest contributions
to periodical literature. It can hardly add to his
great reputation, though it fully sustains it. “The
Snow-Image,” with which the volume commences, is
one of those delicate creations which no imagination
less etherial and less shaping than Hawthorne’s could
body forth. “Main Street,” a sketch but little known,
is an exquisite series of historical pictures, which bring
the persons and events in the history of Salem, vividly
home to the eye and the fancy. “Ethan Brand,” one of
the most powerful of Hawthorne’s works, is a representation
of a man, tormented with a desire to discover
the unpardonable sin, and ending with finding it in his
own breast. “The Great Stone Face,” a system of
philosophy given in a series of characterizations, contains,
among other forcible delineations, a full length of
Daniel Webster. The volume contains a dozen other
tales, some of them sunny in sentiment and subtle in
humor, with touches as fine and keen as Addison’s or
Steele’s: and others dark and fearful, as though the shadow
of a thunder-cloud fell on the author’s page as he
wrote. All are enveloped in the atmosphere, cheerful
or sombre, of the mood of mind whence they proceeded,
and all convey that unity of impression which indicates
a firm hold on one strong conception. As stories, they
arrest, fasten, fascinate attention; but, to the thoughtful
reader they are not merely tales, but contributions to
the philosophy of the human mind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This elegant volume, sumptuous in its binding and
finely printed and illustrated, meets a want both in the
traveled and the untraveled public. The work of a gentleman
who knows every nook and corner of the empire
city by personal observation, and who, by his large acquaintance

history, is enabled to point out all the localities consecrated
by genius and heroism; it is full of interesting and
attractive matter to all readers. As a guide to London,
it will be found a genial as well as a knowing companion
to the tourist. We have been especially pleased with
those portions which describe the shops of the booksellers
and the residences of the authors. The volume is

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>Memoirs of Margaret Fuller Ossoli. Boston: Phillips,
Sampson &amp; Co. 2 vols. 12mo.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>This biography is the work of three “eminent hands”—William
H. Channing, James Freeman Clarke, and
Ralph Waldo Emerson, each writing that portion of Margaret’s
life most familiar to himself. The result is one
of the most curious, attractive and stimulating books of
the season. The impression it conveys of the subject of
the memoirs, is of a woman “large in heart and brain,”
of great vigor and depth of nature, accomplished in many
literatures, with an understanding capacious and masculine,
and with a sensibility somewhat irregular and
chaotic, in which powerful passions, delicate emotions
and vague aspirations, seem never to have been harmonized
into unity. The character, however, in spite of
many limitations and some petty traits, was generally
large and noble, and its essential excellence is not only
demonstrated by the private journals and correspondence
contained in these volumes, but by the fact that she
merited the esteem and admiration of three such men as
her biographers. Her defects are promptly admitted by
all three, but in the opinion of all three they were superficial
in comparison with the real graces and powers of
her mind. In all those letters and journals in which her
soul finds adequate expression, in which her most secret
thoughts and most genuine aspirations are revealed, she
is invariably true and noble; egotism, satire and pique
have in them no place.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Emerson’s portion of these memoirs is done with
his usual felicity of phrase and sharpness of statement,
and is as attractive as any of his essays. He writes in a
kindly spirit, and is evidently a genuine admirer of his
subject, but his friendship is unaccompanied with exaggeration,
and is combined with his usual austere but
graceful honesty in stating his whole opinion. Thus, he
gives the first impression which Miss Fuller made on
him in these unflattering words: “Her extreme plainness—a
trick of incessantly opening and shutting her
eyelids—the nasal tone of her voice—all repelled; and I
said to myself we shall never get far. It is to be said
that Margaret made a disagreeable first impression on
most persons, including those who became afterward
her best friends, to such an extreme that they did not
wish to be in the same room with her. This was partly
the effect of her manners, which expressed an overweening
sense of power and slight esteem of others, and partly
the prejudice of her fame. She had a dangerous reputation
for satire, in addition to her great scholarship. The
men thought she carried too many guns, and the women
did not like one who despised them.” He also gives
some amusing instances of her self-esteem. “Margaret
at first astonished and repelled us by a complacency that
seemed the most assured since the days of Scaliger.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
She occasionally let slip, with all the innocence imaginable,
some phrase betraying the presence of a rather
mountainous <span style='font-size:smaller'>ME</span>, in a way to surprise those who knew
her good sense. She could say, as if she were stating a
scientific fact, in enumerating the merits of somebody,
‘He appreciates <span style='font-size:smaller'>ME</span>.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Emerson accounts for this egotism partly on the
ground of hereditary organization, and partly on “an
ebullient sense of power, which she felt to be in her, and
which as yet had found no channels.” In further illustration
of this he adds, that in conversation she seldom,
“except as a special grace, admitted others upon an
equal ground with herself.” She was exceedingly tender,
when she pleased to be, and most cherishing in her influence;
but to elicit this tenderness, it was necessary
to submit first to her personally. When a person was
overwhelmed by her and answered not a word, except
‘Margaret, be merciful to me a sinner,’ then her love
and tenderness would come like a seraph’s, and often an
acknowledgment that she had been too harsh, and even
a craving for pardon, with a humility—which, perhaps,
she had caught from the other. But her instinct was not
humility—that was an after thought.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This peculiarity, so honestly stated by Mr. Emerson,
probably made Margaret Fuller all her enemies; and it is
a fault which every person is bound to resent, though it
appeared in an angel or archangel. It cannot be justified
though it may be accounted for; and by those who knew
her best, it was explained on principle! which relieved
it of positive offensiveness. Some of her intellectual dependents,
persons who gloried in wearing her mental
livery, and were delighted with the servitude she enforced,
might say very naively, in explanation, that Margaret
was the greatest woman that ever was, and that
Margaret was very sincere, and that being sincere it was
very proper that she should not conceal her knowledge
even of her own greatness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In our opinion this egotism was the result of the vigor
of her nature, which, in conversation, broke all conventional
bounds, and came out in its whole wealth of
thought and acquisition, eager for controversy or ravenous
for sympathy, and communicating to her mind a
bright and strong sense of individual power which at the
time almost palliated its excesses. The excitement of
her mind produced that effect which we often see in
persons who are enraged—a condition in which expressions,
regretted afterward for their extravagance, seem
at the time too weak to convey the hot feeling of wrong
which burns beneath them. In her journals, where she
sharply scrutinises what she is and what she has produced,
and where there is no excitement to stimulate
her powers, she is sufficiently humble, acutely feels her
imperfections, and the “mountainous me” dwindles into
a mole-hill. She seems to have had the aspirations and
the ambitions of great genius, had sufficient breadth of
mind to take in the wide varieties of human power in
history and literature, and had a corresponding scorn for
the little and the common in mental effort; but she lacked
a creative imagination, and was incapable of producing
anything which at all realized the intimations of her nature.
In conversation she rose instantly into sympathetic
companionship with creative minds, and in the
heat of the moment mistook it for a companionship and
community in power. In this mood she might despise
many who were her superiors in the shaping power of
genius, though her inferiors in its loftiest aspirations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These volumes are full of instances of her sincerity,
her geniality, her love of the beautiful in nature and art,
her fine critical powers, her enthusiasm for great measures
of reform in America and Europe, and the noble
scale on which she conducted her mental and moral culture.
Though many may take exception to the generosity
of the praise which her biographers lavish on her
various graces and gifts of mind, every one must acknowledge
the extreme richness of the materials which
are frankly exhibited, to enable the reader to judge for
himself. We doubt if there is any other American biography
in which the whole interior truth relating to the
character of the subject is so completely set forth, or
which presents to the curious in mental organization so
interesting a study in psychology.</p>

Though this gives emphasis to the ethical intent of the
authoress, she sacrifices to it some of the most important
principles of the true method of characterization. Her
persons are apt to slide into personified passions.</p>

book gives short but admirable sketches of a great number

her space hardly allows her to do full justice to the subject,
she uses her materials so skillfully, and writes her

<p class='pindent'>The first of these little volumes is the record of a child,
who died just as her mind was expanding into affection
and intelligence; and it is the most notable book of the
kind we have ever seen. As giving the psychology of a
mother’s feelings, it is well worthy of attention. It is
written close to the heart of the matter, and is full of
examples of that searching pathos which calls up instinctive
tears. Rarely have we read a work of more
affectionate intensity, or one in which a mournful experience,
tempered by religious faith, is expressed with
such genuine simplicity and truth to inward emotion.
There are passages whose eloquence is so identical with
the things it celebrates, that the reader sees and feels
with hardly the consciousness of the agency of words.
The other volume is a collection of poetry relating to
children, in which the mother’s heart, so constantly present
in the previous volume, ranges over the whole field
of poetry, hoarding the precious lyrics which bring consolation
by inspiring religious trust. Both works are
of a peculiar character, indicating the presiding influence
of one overmastering feeling, and striking at
the very sources of emotion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Our Small-Talk has afforded food for infinite jest to a
few unfledged wits and cubs of critics, clever word-snappers,
who keep reiterating the joke that the Small-Talk

so called and set down originally in the bills. So do not
imagine that you are discoverers, and set yourselves off
to the Polar regions in search of Sir John Franklin.
The Small-Talk is more than <span class='it'>small</span>—it is pert, impudent,
audacious, outrageous, insolent, and, cool. More than
that, it is—“to be continued.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Well—what are the arguments of the opponents of the
“Maine Law!” We have heard them—having been present
at the grand gathering of Distillers, Rum-sellers, and
Drinkers at Tripler Hall, on Friday evening, the 27th of
February. About as precious a set of “jolly fellows” as
we ever saw in all our life, were there assembled to listen
to the advantages of dying by slow poison. We give a
picture, which sets forth the point and moral of the
matter.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/i253.jpg' alt='' id='iid-0011' style='width:70%;height:auto;'/>
<p class='caption'>Arguments of the opponents of the Maine law—<span class='it'>illustrated</span>.</p>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>This was the pith and marrow of the whole affair.
“Rum was”—Well, what? Why—“Rum!” Every
body was enlightened and saw clearly. There was not a
shadow of doubt about the matter. Its character was not
in the least altered—it was the same devil, only painted a
little red—not at all improved either, by the artists—in
fact, Mr. Camp made him rather more hideous by attempting
to make him a facetious, jolly sort of a devil, without
any evil quality, but much given to poetry, philosophy,
and particularly, mechanics. His <span class='it'>inventive</span> powers, however,
were not brought out quite as clearly as Mr. Camp’s
own, who, with a fine delivery and sonorous ring of voice,
did all that it was possible for man to do in a bad cause—still
he did not <span class='it'>do</span>—at least, not the majority there assembled.
The whole affair was a horrible jest—it was—Yes!
it was a <span class='sc'>Rum</span>-joke—and nothing else.</p>

<p class='pindent'>No one was hardy enough to attempt to <span class='it'>prove</span>, that
Rum ever made a great man greater—or improved the
mental calibre of a small one. Ever warmed the heart
of a miser to do an unrepented act of generosity—or
enlarged the soul to permanent and consistent acts of
lofty heroism for the welfare of mankind. Ever filled
the cottage with smiling faces and happy hearts, permanently—shed
plenty upon the tables of the poor, or
made a wife happier or children more respected—ever, in
short, carried any thing but a concealed curse in its bright
bubbles and brilliant hues.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We came away with no change of opinion as to the
deleterious effects of Rum as a beverage. Taken either
at the social board, with jolly good fellows, or among
wits, poets and philosophers—it carries the same horror
on its front, the same death in its smile. Even the
sounding-boards, from which the notes of Jenny Lind
floated out, almost divinely, gave no music to the
voice of Rum’s advocate—the best joke had a croak—and
the laughter a horribly consumptive sound.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

    Chief Executive and Director
    gbnewby@pglaf.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
